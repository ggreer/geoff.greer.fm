Senior Software Engineer

([CoreOS was acquired by Red Hat](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-acquire-coreos-expanding-its-kubernetes-and-containers-leadership).)
- After the acquisition, Red Hat chose to use the Tectonic Console codebase for their [new OpenShift Console](https://github.com/openshift/console). See [the project's contributor stats](https://github.com/openshift/console/graphs/contributors) to get some idea of my work.
