title: My Development Environment
---

A substantial number of people have asked me about my development environment. What sort of hardware do I use? What operating system suits me? What text editor do I favor? Etcetera. Well, here are my answers.


### Hardware

I'm of the opinion that hardware doesn't matter that much, yet is [worth spending lots of money on]({% post_url 2010-10-30-expensive-computers-are-worth-the-price %}). I currently use a 7th generation [Lenovo X1 Carbon](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ThinkPad_X1_Carbon). It has a [Core i5-10210U](https://ark.intel.com/content/www/us/en/ark/products/195436/intel-core-i5-10210u-processor-6m-cache-up-to-4-20-ghz.html), 16GB of RAM, and a 2TB SSD. The 14" screen has a resolution of 3840x2160 and a brightness up to 500 [nits](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Candela_per_square_metre).


### Software

I run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org/) with [Sway](https://github.com/swaywm/sway/), a [tiling window manager](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tiling_window_manager) similar to [i3](https://i3wm.org/). My Sway configuration (along with many other configs) is avaliable in [my dotfiles repository](https://github.com/ggreer/dotfiles).

My main editor is [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). My shell is [zsh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Z_shell).
