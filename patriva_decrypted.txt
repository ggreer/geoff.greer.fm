As has been [discussed](http://relsqui.livejournal.com/1350981.html#cutid1) [elsewhere](http://lesswrong.com/lw/2q6/compartmentalization_in_epistemic_and/2myw?c=1), Less Wrong is currently fairly unapproachable to newbies. In particular, the learning curve is ridiculously steep. People who have read a few posts are told, in effect, to read the [entire archives](http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/ArchiveBinge) **[TVTropes]** before commenting.

Suppose there were a separate discussion area dedicated specifically to those who are just starting out, or perhaps who have taken a few of the [first steps](http://wiki.lesswrong.com/wiki/Sequences#Core_Sequences) down the road. When posting there, it would be considered poor etiquette to expect others to have read later material, like expecting fourth-graders to know trigonometry, or high school graduates to be able to read Feynman diagrams. Ideally there would be a series of tiers of discussion, so that people can learn the material interactively, like in a classroom, rather than doing the equivalent of shutting themselves in a closet with a textbook.

In order to [motivate](http://lesswrong.com/lw/p0/to_spread_science_keep_it_secret/) people, of course, we should lock up the higher-level discussion areas behind tests of merit. We should also think of some sort of standard miracles people can do to publicly demonstrate their Level Six superpowers.
