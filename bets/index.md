When people disagree, I'm a fan of betting. As economist Alex Tabarrok says, [A bet is a tax on bullshit](http://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2012/11/a-bet-is-a-tax-on-bullshit.html). Betting stops people from saying things they don't actually believe.

Below are my bets (and my attempts to bet) in reverse chronological order.

**2017/01** - I'm currently going back-and-forth with [Carl King](http://carlkingdom.com/). He's willing to bet that [President Trump will use nuclear weapons within the next 6 months](https://twitter.com/carlking/status/822128552015314945). [Gwern](https://www.gwern.net/) and I are willing to give him 3:1 odds against. We're still working out the details, but hopefully we can come to an arrangement.

**2016/10** - I bet Aaron Silverbook that upon a Clinton victory in the election, there would be no major unrest. That is: No national guard called to a city. No curfews or martial law declared. As Clinton did not win the election, our bet was nullified.

**2016/09** - I bought $150 worth of Clinton shares on PredictIt at 77 cents per share. Clinton lost the election and I lost $150.

**2008** - I bought $1,000 worth of Obama shares on Intrade at approximately $7/share (a 70% chance of winning). Obama won the election, netting me around $400.
