## Shibboleths

Gun culture has a few [shibboleths](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shibboleth). If you use certain terms, people will write you off as either a newbie or an ignoramus.


### Bullet

A bullet is an inert piece of metal. A round (also called a cartridge) is comprised of a bullet, a casing, a primer, and gunpowder.

When someone says "bullet", it's usually obvious from context whether they mean a round or just a bullet.


### Clip

A magazine is part of the gun that holds ammunition. Often the magazine is detachable. This makes reloading quicker and more convenient, as you can eject the empty magazine and insert a full one.

A [clip](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clip_(firearms)) is a device that holds ammunition so that it can be quickly loaded into a magazine. These may be in the form of stripper clips, or the more ornate en-bloc clips used by the [M1 Garand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/M1_Garand).

People usually know from context whether "clip" means "magazine", but again, using "clip" incorrectly will cause people to judge you.
