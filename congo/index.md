title: 'Democratic Republic of Congo: Lubumbashi to Kinshasa'
---

In October of 2010, a Belgian couple (Josephine and Frederik) decided to spend a month driving their Landcruiser across the [Democratic Republic of the Congo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Democratic_Republic_of_the_Congo). That alone would be quite an adventure, but they added one extra rule to their trip:

They refused to pay any bribes.

*Yeah.*

Below is their story as told by them. This is a mirror of [their posts on the Expedition Portal forums](https://expeditionportal.com/forum/threads/democratic-republic-of-congo-lubumbashi-to-kinshasa.50799/). The original thread is very long and contains many unsubstantiative comments from onlookers. The version below has edited those out and contains only the words and images written by the couple. All spelling and syntax errors are kept from the original posts.

Enjoy!

The Michelin is a pretty good map but it has a few known flaws. One of 
the biggest flaws is probably the "Route National 1" in DRC.. as we are 
soon to find out...<br>

 story starts in Pionee... No, that's not true, it actually starts 2 
years earlier, but I will come back to that later. So for now let's 
start this story at in Pioneer campsite just outside Lusaka where we 
treat ourselves on some home made French fries (but as you all know, 
French fries have got nothing to do with France, as they have been 
invented by the Belgians!)<br>

We deserved it as it had been about 600 days since we last seen set foot
 in our home country and we missed the food! The other reason was that 
we were not expecting to be eating good in the next month or two. After 
all we were about to go deep into the Congo (Democtratic Republic of 
Congo, Congo-Kinshasa or Congo-Zaire, all the same but I will refer to 
it simply as "Congo"). <br>
<br>
As supplies would be very hard to get we decided to stock up on 
supplies. I know that for South Africans it very normal to transport an 
entire pick&amp;pay to your destination  :twisted:  but for us this was 
very unusual as we usually eat what we can find. But not so in this 
case, we bought food for an entire month. 3 meals a day. This would 
prove to be a very good decision <br>

I also gave the Landcruiser a last service, everything was working 
pretty much as expected, so just the regular oil/filter change. I also 
stocked up on some good oil (diff + engine) as this would also be hard 
to get there.<br>

Fully loaded we left Lusaka. We always had a strange anxious/nervous 
feeling when entering a new country. But this time the feeling was much 
stronger. Was this the first time we were actualy nervous for entering a
 country?</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The border at Kasumbalesa was 
the usual chaotic affair. Especially the Zambian side proved to be an 
annoying experience. Many pushy touts and very crowded. The Congolese 
side on the other hand had very little touts. It was chaotic too, but 
much smoother then their neighbours.<br>
<br>
We were warned about the "5$ dollar first entry" bribe at the Congolese side.<br>
<br>
This conversation was in French ofcourse:<br>
<br>
Customs Officer: "Hi, that'll be 5$US"<br>
- Me: "Ofcourse,but what is it for exactly?"<br>
CO: "Tourist tax"<br>
- Me: "Oh, I was not aware of the existance of a tourist tax?"<br>
CO: "Yes, but only on the first entry"<br>
- Me: "Aaaah, ofcourse how could I forget. I already paid this when I 
entered at by boat in Kinshasa a few months ago" &lt;-- I lied, there is
 no such tax and I never paid such tax. But I did have the proof of my 
previous entry in Congo in my passport<br>
Co: *long silence*<br>
Co: *hesitating* "You still have to pay..."<br>
<br>
He lost, I won. He knew it but he would not give in ofcourse. I sat 
there for another 10 minutes before I was let go without any further 
words. This went smoothyl... very smoothly! I was starting to think that
 all these corruption stories about Congo were overrated. Little did I 
know at that time...<br>
<br>
We actually bougt insurance at the border. Not that we believe that it 
would be of any use in case of an accident. But just to avoid the bribes
 associated with not having any insurance.<br>
<br>
Next obstacle was the road tax for the short distance between the border
 and Lubumbashi. 50US$ for foreigners! I waited until a lorry was 
waiting at the barrier and then just drove past it and floored it. 50$ 
in the pocket <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"><br>
<br>
We are normally very principle about official (!!!) taxes, we just pay 
them as they usually benefit the roads, etc.. . In this case it is known
 that all of the money for this road toll goes directly to Kinsahsa. 
Nothing ever returns to the maintenance of these roads, or anything 
remotely related to the province it is in. It shows:<br>

We arrived in Lubumbashi - "Capital du cuivre" (Capital of Copper) and 
were instantly stopped by the police. Checked all papers, checked 
vehicle, asked for "Un jus" (cold drink). Very pushy and aggressive. We 
got rid of them but two blocks further we got stopped again. Same story.
 This was getting tiring!<br>
<br>
We just stopped stopping altogether after a while. It was obvious that 
our white skin and strange number plates attracted a lot of unwanted 
attention! <br>
<br>
At the border we had been lucky to bump into a Belgian lady. She was 
living in Lubumbashi together with Soeur Bernadette, a Congolese "Maman"
 (literally translated = mother). She invited us to stay at her place.<br>
<br>
They lived in a lovely little villa called "Bonne Esperance". They take 
of orphans and constantly have 3 or 4 children living in the house. 
There was no room in the house, but we could stay in our rtt in the 
driveway. They were wonderful people, we really enjoyed staying there.<br>

They also had no electricity when we where there. When we inquired about
 this (after all, this was central Lubumbashi) we were told about the 
odd system in Lubumbashi. Because the electricy factory is in such a bad
 state it cannot cope with the demand. Therefore there is always one 
area that gets no electricity. They change the area every week or so.<br>
<br>
The next few days we spent in Lubumbashi arranging all sorts of things. 
Money, Permits, information, ... The word went round quickly that 
Belgian tourists had arrived and our network of contact grew by the 
minute. Soon we were welcome guests in the Belgian Consulate and we 
moved to another house of Belgians working in Lubumbashi. They worked 
for CTB, the Belgian aid organisation. These contacts would prove 
extremely valuable during our trip.<br>
<br>
We also got in touch with the director of the big coper mine in Lubumbashi and were invited for a tour of the factory</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-13-1587032494" data-lb-id="_xfUid-13-1587032494">

Congo must be one of the richest countries in the world. They could have
 been the Dubai of Africa with what they have in the ground. Ever since 
their independance the biggest mining company in Congo is Gécamines. 
Once a hugely profitable company it is now only a shadow of its former 
self. Years of corruption and mismanagement have left Gécamines in a 
state of defacto bankrupt. All their mines are nothing more but ruins. <br>
<br>
Info about Gécamines: <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%A9camines" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/forum/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FG%25C3%25A9camines&amp;hash=2868982c50ad29a651c6b2fe35163aa6" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gécamines</a><br>
<br>
The ruins of these mines are now home to many "creuseurs". Usually young
 children who are digging in the remains of the mines for whatever is 
left. They work long days and have to give most of their profit to 
organised gangs.<br>
<br>
The mine in Lubumbashi also has a huge pile of mining waste. The pile is
 actually still so rich in cobalt and copper that a foreign company 
(Forest) is running a production factory. <br>

<br>
Nobody really know what kind of permit one needs, let alone where to 
apply for it. But everybody agrees that a permit is required. Officially
 it has got something to do with the many mining areas to be crossed. We
 contacted the few people who have attempted travelling trough congo but
 they too never managed to get hold of the permit. One of these guys did
 get arrested and deported because he could not provide a permit.<br>
Our Belgian Consulate really tried hard to get this stupid little piece 
of paper for us, but to no avail. They even managed to get us invited 
with the governer of Katanga, but he too could not give it to us. After 
many days of trying we asked the consulate to give us some sort of 
official looking letter with an official looking stamp. We would chance 
it without the permit!<br>

The permit is on the right. It has no real value, it basicly says no 
more then "There are tourist from Belgium and they are travelling trough
 congo, please assist them in their travels". But then in official 
speak.<br>
On the left are copies of all sorts of other official documents. We had aout 30 copies of all of these.<br>
This is our DRC visa:<br>

It's time to hit the road!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">After leaving
 Lubumbashi one quickly arrives at yet another toll booth. 50$US again 
(!) for a short piece of horribly potholed tarmac. This time I stop the 
car a long end before the booth and walk to get my ticket. There is a 
big "queue" (read: a pile of people). I just stuck my arm trough the 
window without letting them see myself and give the equivalent amount 
for locals (1$US). They give me back a receipt and presto. Another 49$ 
saved!<br>
<br>
The road starts out good<br>

<br>
<br>
We make good progress until we hit the end of a traffic jam. A seemingly
 endless series of big lorries stand still on the entire width of the 
road. We stop and are greeted with demands for "cadeaux", "un jus", 
etc... Mind you, these are not officials, they are just the 
truckdrivers.<br>
<br>
Josephine stays in the car while I walk to the front of the queue (a 
kilomter or so). In the valley there is a huge mud pit that just about 
swallowed an articulated lorry. This obviously happened quite some time 
ago. Next to it is another lorry stuck, leaning dangerously. Next to 
that one is yet another stuck lorry. And another, ... There are 5 
lorries next to eachother. All stuck. This is now blocking the entire 
road. 20 man are digging away but when they see me they instantly stop 
and start shouting at me <br>
<br>
"Hé le Blanc!" <br>
"Mundele!' = mzungu <br>
"Le Blanc, Il va payer!" = The white guy, he is going to pay (if I want to pass)<br>
"Donner moi de l'argent" = Give me money<br>
<br>
There were about a 100 people on the side of road watching the spectacle
 and they started laughing at me and shouting all sorts of nasty things.
 <br>
<br>
This entire situation felt very treatening and I just wanted to get out 
of there as quickly as possible. While walking back to Josephine some 
more friendly people talked to me. Apparantly they had been there for 4 
days now without any movement. But they said small 4x4's could get past.<br>
<br>
Not without hesitation we started negotiating our way trough the parked 
trucks and around the mudpit. You could see that the crowd was just 
waiting for us to get stuck.<br>
<br>
Fortunately we got trough.<br>
<br>
Sorry, no pictures of this mess. The enviroment was just to hostile to start flashing expensive cameras.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">When
 we continued on the same road we would pass other smaller mudpits. 
These bogholes always had a "crew". When a truck arrived, they would 
throw in rocks so the truck could pass... for a fee ofcourse. After the 
truck passed they removed the rocks again. A lucrative occupation!<br>
<br>
In our books this is just plain wrong and we refuse to support such 
behaviour. So we always charged trough in 4x4, hoping we would not get 
ourself stuck.<br>
<br>
We neared the first town: Likasi. At the town border we got stopped by 
an agressive bunch of policeman - 12 of them to be exactly. They quickly
 made it clear that we did not have the necessary permit and therefore 
we were under arrest!<br>
<br>
Oops!  8O<br>
<br>
Come to think of it. It is rather disturbing that I can say that I know 
what to do in such a situation. First thing to do is to remain calm and -
 politely - deny that you are under arrest. This may sound strange, but 
it is a simple test and always worked for me. If they are serious they 
will just take you to a police station. If they start discussing you 
know you'll be allright and they are trying to discriminate you but the 
goal is just to get a bribe.<br>
<br>
They started discussing. This was good. It was a heated discussion 
though and they clearly were not amused. It took us the best part of an 
hour to make them believe that our "official letter from the embassy" 
was a valid permit. They probably never saw a "tourist" permit before 
(does it even exist?) and we could tell they were not sure about their 
case. The official stamps did the trick.<br>
<br>
They turned their attention to the Landcruiser, checked al the lights, windscreen wipers, fire extinguisher (Yes, we had 2  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite6" alt=":cool:" title="Cool    :cool:" data-shortname=":cool:"> ), emergency triangle (Yes, we had 2  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite6" alt=":cool:" title="Cool    :cool:" data-shortname=":cool:">
  ) and finally found a culprit: we only had 1 reversing light!  I 
explained that in Belgium only 1 reversing light is obligatory (its 
true) and still refused to pay anything. Then things turned a bit ugly. 
Without a doubt they just wanted to make a quick buck from us and they 
were getting impatient. We heard somebody kicking the car, they started 
shouting and made it very clear that we are in Congo and that they were 
the boss here and we should listen and pay. They tried opening both 
doors at the same time (locked) and started shouting we were arrested 
and we had to go to the "police station". NOW!<br>
<br>
This was bad. No more room for negotiations. At all costs did we want to
 prevent ending up in a police station as that would mean bad news! As a
 final resort I called our embassy and they talked to the police 
officers. Their names and ranks were asked - which they refused to give.
 At the same time Josephine kicked into action. The people here that 
know Josephine can surely attest that although she is tough as nails, 
she is truly an incredible sweet girl. She got very angry at the police 
officers and got very cross. This made an impression. They kept us there
 for another half hour but lost interest eventually.<br>
<br>
Before we were let go one office said "Ce n'est pas la Belgique ici, tu 
es en Congo!" - "This is not Belgium, you are in Congo". He hissed and 
gave us a terrifying look<br>
<br>
With our adrenaline levels at maximum we continued into Likasi.<br>
<br>
We did not even drive for a full kilometer or we were stopped again by the police..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">This
 time it was a jolly fat guy. He laughed when he stopped us, gave us a 
friendly hello and without skipping a beat continued that we had to pay a
 fine. "Malchargé" (badly loaded) he claimed. At the same time a truck 
passed with a dozen people hanging of the back.<br>
<br>
That was the funniest thing we heard all day and we burst out laughing. 
He too joined in the laughing. Anyhow, back to reality so we just said 
goodbye and started to drive of. He jumped onto the driving boards and 
asked for "un jus" in a final attempt before letting go.<br>
<br>
The good gravel road continued for a short while after Likasi but 
continues to a mining town. That is ofcourse the reason that this road 
exists, the mine. The Route National 1 (RN1) - the highway to Kinshasa -
 forks of at a small village called Tenke. The track immediately changed
 in a sandy jungle track.<br>

We passed a few small villages. No more trace of Police on this smaller 
road. What a relief! There was also barely any traffic. We helped a 
small truck that somehow managed to get stuck next to the road.<br>

The road forked again a short while later at Tshilongo. The main track

It had rained a lot lately, but in the sand this caused no real 
problems. Until we hid some sort of a marsh. We passed many traces of

3 hours of digging. Sandpates, hi-lift, the whole lot. Sweating like a 
pig. We could barely hear eachother with all the insect buzzing around 
our ears. But we managed to get out.<br>
<br>
In the dark we were greeted by the priests in the mission. Before we 
could even say something they said "Il faut rien dire, on comprend!" - 
"No need to talk, we understand". They were friendly and gave us a 
bucket of water to wash in. We could park the car in their garden. We

The mission is at the same time a (boarding) school. During our little 
muddy ordeal of the day before a bolt broke off from our wheelcarrier. 
We did not have a spare bolt of that size, but the mission had a lathe 
so they could make one for us. This had to wait until noon because then 
the generator would be running for an hour. We decided to have a rest 
day. That gave us plenty of time to reflect on the previous day.<br>
<br>
We like kids, but we were silently hoping they would have to go to class
 today so we could have some rest. Alas, it was a holiday so we were 
bombarded to babysitter for the day  :roll:   :wink:  <br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The priests (Brothers actually) 
are nice guys. There are 4 of them, young and smart. All of them have 
studied in Lubumbashi or Kinshasa. After they finished the seminary they
 were sent to a mission. They cannot choose which one. We could hear the
 sadness in their voices when they told their stories.<br>
<br>
They sampled the "world" when studying, they have a degree (one of them 
had a masters in engineering) and then they are sent to a mission. They 
know they will probably never have the chance again to live in a city. 
At the mission they take care of the kids, teach, etc.. A noble and 
rewarding job. But they carry all this knowledge that they cannot put in
 practice here. They have no computers, no tools, no electricity, no 
budget, ...<br>
<br>
Their living quarters were very comfy and clean for Congolese standards.
 They had a radio and a TV set. Because of their proximity to Lubumbashi
 they had a regular supply of newspapers.<br>
<br>
The priest-engineer was setting up a project to generate clean energy 
from a river. He had a recycling project. A radio project. An irrigation
 project, ...  He had to run all these projects without any funds, 
without material. So many ideas, so little chances.<br>
<br>
They remained positive but you could see it in their eyes that they were
 sad. Without a doubt they would take the first opportunity to get out 
of there. It would be a great loss for the mission and the village but I
 couldn't blame them. In the way our talks went we thought we could hear
 them crying for help. To take them to Europe, to give them funds, to 
supply them with material. They did not speak these words, but to us it 
was clear that they really longed for those things. We were not able to 
provide this. It made us sad and we felt guilty.<br>
<br>
We thought about our experiences of the previous day. As mentioned 
before we always had this nervousness/anxiousness when going to a <i>new</i>
 country. Usually it dissapeared within minutes when we were welcomed by
 friendly people in a friendly country. We had been in Congo for a week 
now. Of which we only spent 1 day on the road. But the nervousness was 
still there.<br>
<br>
It seemed like so many Congolese tried their best to make us feel 
unwelcome. And the few friendly people we met made us feel totally out 
of place with their tragic stories. So many people expected that we 
would be able to help them. Could we stand it to keep dissapointing 
those people? <i>We are just tourists passing trough.. </i> it feels wrong.<br>
<br>
Was it wrong to come to Congo? Would it be like this for the rest of our
 trip? We are already exhausted after a single day on the road. The 
corruption, the roads... where we taking too many risks now?<br>
<br>
Never before on our travels did we have so many doubts about what we 
were doing. My motto always is "Better to be sorry about what you did, 
then to be sorry about you did not do". I am fortunate to have found a 
partner who thinks exactly the same. We made a deal: as soon as somebody
 'had enough' we would turn around - no questions asked.<br>
<br>
We decided to push on, after all we have gotten this far already!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 3</b><br>
<br>
Our second driving day starts off great! <br>
<br>
In this area large areas are given in lease to cow farms. They are 
profitable organisations (mostly owned by foreigners) and maintain their
 own roads on their property. They can be used by the general public, 
although sometimes a fee is asked. As the main road is usually pretty 
horrible, we prefer the private roads. We make good progress on these 
beautiful sandy tracks.<br>

some guy claiming we have to pay a toll fee. At that moment we did not 
know that this is generally accepted when you make use of the private 
roads. We were still a bit jumpy from our previous experiences with the 
police so we might have been a bit rude to the guy  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite10" alt=":oops:" title="Oops!    :oops:" data-shortname=":oops:">  We got trough without paying  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite10" alt=":oops:" title="Oops!    :oops:" data-shortname=":oops:"> He probably though we were completely nuts  :wink:</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The

 were on a plain on top of a hill. It looked as if a B52 dropped a

the car, but no movement. Probably stuck as well.<br>

We got out relatively fast only to get ourselves stuck in the next pit.

They declared us crazy that we were planning to drive to Kin... nobody 
does that. But apparantely after the crater field the roads improves a 
bit, but it remains "très dur" - "Very hard".</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 passed a few interesting settlements. One village in particular struck 
me as extremely fascinating. It had a big boulevard with grand buildings
 on both sides. Everything was in a horrible state, but it must have 
been a prestigous place before. The same village had a big roundabout 
with remains of fountain. There was a walled compound (with little wall 
remaining ) with a church and something that must have been a monastery.<br>
<br>
So many interesting things. I would have loved to walk around here, 
explore, try to find out what it all was. But we couldn't. Stopping 
would mean that an instant crowd would form and it would be a question 
of minutes before all the town's officials would be there. Asking for 
permits and generally demanding money.<br>
<br>
We didn't even take pictures whilst driving trough. I could kick myself for it now!<br>
<br>
Not only is this country rich in raw materials, it also rich in history,
 nature, etc... it has all the reasons why tourist would pay prime 
tourist $dollars$. But that will not happen anytime soon for sure..  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite15" alt=":cry:" title="Crying    :cry:" data-shortname=":cry:"> <br>

Not all is bad though. Occasionally (and I must admit, it was a rare event) we meet nice people. Like this guy on his bike.<br>

He was a good example of the older generation. Theygrew up in a 
prosperous (relative) Congo and have seen it go downhill. They still 
have the pride every person should have. The younger generation grew up 
in disastrously f*cked up country and lack the pride. Why should they, 
they know they do not get any chances?<br>
It is that old generation that longs back to the colonial time. They 
acknowledge there were a lot of problems in that period and that they 
were discriminated by the white colonisator. But at least they had a 
functional country. They had roads and schools. They had jobs and could 
buy supplies. And above all, there was stability. Now there is nothing 
but uncertainty.. waiting for the next war to start.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The next 20 or so kilometer the road was better.<br>

We were pushing it a bit. We had been fighting with the road all day 
long without any real pauses. It was getting late and we were hoping to 
reach Luena today, where we know a Belgian brother was living in a 
catholic mission.<br>
<br>
We were pushing it a bit too hard I guess and made a mistake. We normally <i>always</i>
 walk difficult bit before driving it. This time I thought it would be 
ok. The ground looked unstable but I was sure I could make it trough by 
taking enough speed. I did not know, however, that a huge rock was 
blocking the track just behind a curve. I had to stop and we instantly 
sunk in.<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We were tired by now, it was 
getting late again. I was angry with myself because I made this stupid 
mistake. And I fell sorry for Josephine as she offered - as usual - to 
check the road out before driving trough. This could have been 
prevented.<br>
<br>
We got the shovel out and starting working. 5 minutes. That is how long 
it took before the first people arrived. It quickly grew to a crowd of 
about 10 people. <br>
<br>
I was digging to get the sandplate underneath one of the wheels. To 
reach the right spot I had to lay flat down underneath the car in the 
mud. I was eating mud everytime I dug. Josephine at the same time was 
dugging underneath another wheel.<br>
<br>
"Donnez moi de l'argent" - "Give me money" someone asked<br>
<br>
1st time, a second time. The third time he asked I was getting annoyed -
 understatement of the year ;-). I dropped my shovel and tried to get 
up. In doing so I bumped my head hard on the front axle (I was under the
 car in the mud, remember).<br>
<br>
*Laughter*<br>
<br>
I bit my thong and kept on digging.<br>
<br>
"Donnez moi de l'argent"<br>
<br>
Josephine asked the mob why they were asking us money<br>
<br>
"Vous êtes blanc" - "You are white"<br>
<br>
This conversation wouldn't lead anywhere useful...  :roll: She told them
 that we had our own problems, that there would be no way that we would 
give them any money, and that it would be appreciated to just leave us 
alone as they were not really helping by talking to us while we were 
digging. They heard the magic word "<i>help</i>". <i>help</i> is usually associated with <i>reward</i>. So they offered to help us... but only if they would be paid for it.<br>
<br>
Now, we have our pride and can be very stubborn. When I take risks I 
know things can go wrong, and if necessary I will fix it on my own. So I
 told them they were free to help us, but only if they wanted to <i>really</i> help us. I made it very clear that I was not letting me blackmail into this.<br>
<br>
We returned to digging and they stood there and looked.<br>
<br>
We did several attempt of trying to drive out, without much succes. More
 digging was required. Finally somebody took the intiative and offered 
to help out. I told him I was not going to pay and he agreed. It took 
another hour to liberate ourselves.<br>
<br>
I offered the people that voluntarily helped some money to show my 
gratitude. That is just the right thing to do. They accepted but wanted 
more. <br>
<br>
We drove off...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We lost a lot of time 
and we only had 20 minutes of daylight left. Our goal for that day - The
 mission in Luena - was another 50kilometers away. We would not make it.
 We would have to stay in a village<br>

</blockquote>We stopped in the next village. The crowd that gathered 
grew huge very quickly. There must have been about 200 man around us. We
 asked if there was a church here, and if we could see the priest. The 
priest was summoned and we asked him if we could camp in the grounds of 
the church. His French was not very good. As a matter of fact, very few 
people spoke French. But he ageed and showed us a place.<br>
<br>
We parked the car and got out. They offered us two chairs and asked us 
to sit. So we did. It was completely dark by now but almost full moon so
 we could see eachother well.<br>
<br>
And there we were: sitting on a chair with 400 eyes looking at us. 
Nobody talked to us, they just looked. You could hear people talking to 
eachother and pointing at us... usually followed by some giggling. These
 people obviously had no idea what was happening to them. Neither did we
  8O <br>
<br>
The town's officials arrived and wanted to see our papers and we had to 
"register". They were friendly but very confused about what to do. We 
asked if we could have some water to wash ourselves which they 
immediately fetched... it was even warm! And we even got a bar of soap! 
But there was sill 200 man staring at us... . We hid behind the car and 
tried to wash us as good as possible.<br>
<br>
It started raining.<br>
<br>
A father approached us with a kid. The kid instantly started crying when
 he saw us. The father told us the kid had never seen a white person 
before. A few more kids were brought in to have them see the great 
mystery of white skin.<br>
<br>
Although we were hungry, this did not seem the best place to get our 
cooking gear out, so we smugled a packet of biltong and some biscuits up
 in the tent and went to sleep. The crowd stayed for a long time after 
we dissapeared in our tent.<br>
<br>
That night it rained hard. Our tent had developped some leaks. Every few minutes we could feel drops splashing on our body..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Our progress on our second day of driving (in blue)<br>

Small eyes... dirty t-shirt.<br>
<br>
We got up with the first light at 5. We have a custom that we pay the 
equivalent of the price of a campsite if we can stay with somebody, so 
we paid our dues to the priest and we were off. The entire village waved
 us out and the kids tried to keep up with us for as long as they could.<br>

Staying in villages is great for security. People are friendly. But boy-oh-boy forgot about privacy!<br>

I slept ok, no surprise as I was exhausted. Josephine did not sleep very
 well. The adrenaline. The leaking tent didn't help either. We stopped a

I wasn't hungry. The adrenaline. For a moment Josephine thought about 
stopping and returning to Lubum. The last few days were really hard and 
we were still a veeeery long way from Kinshasa. As agreed before we 
would not try to convince eachother to push on. She contemplated the 
situation for half an hour with a warm tea. She is no quiter, she wanted
 to continue! She is my Josephine!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite6" alt=":cool:" title="Cool    :cool:" data-shortname=":cool:">  :cheers: <br>

We were still aiming for Luena. The road was ok but had lots of water in
 so called "flaques d'eau" - "Puddles". Often the road would be 
completely immersed. It could be less then 1 cm deep, but it might as 
well be 1 meter deep.<br>
<br>
We (I  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite10" alt=":oops:" title="Oops!    :oops:" data-shortname=":oops:">
 )had learned my lesson from yesterday so we really stopped before every
 obstacle. Josephine did the recce. And then we continued... carefully. 
It took a lot of time, but getting stuck takes a lot more time.<br>

They were on their way to Kananga. Same directions as us. They had 
bought the vehicle in Lubumbashi but did not have the money to transport
 to Kananga, so they decided to drive. They were pretty deseperate by 
now as their "new" car getting damaged by the road and it took them much
 longer then anticipated. We would pass eachother a few times. We never 
knew if they made it to their destination.<br>
<br>
There is no trough traffic at all on this traject. All transport in the 
area is done by train. There is an old colonial trainline between 
Lubumbashi and Kananga. All transport is done via this train or by air. <br>
<br>
All in all it was a plesant day. Sun was shining (that's good because it
 dries out the roads), no major problems with police, and above all: it 
was the first day since we entered congo that we did not get ourselves 
stuck! What a feature!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite6" alt=":cool:" title="Cool    :cool:" data-shortname=":cool:"> <br>

details from Frère Louis via our connections in Lubumbashi. We had 
already called him, but unfortunately he was not home. He was at the 
main mission post in Kamina for some meetings. He was kind enough to 
inform his own mission that we were coming and to let us stay there.<br>
<br>
And so we had a leisurely afternoon at his mission. We must say that at 
first we were a bit dissapointed. Thus far the missions were havens of 
peace and quiet. Were things were functional (sometimes) and clean 
(sometimes). Not so at the home of Frère Louis. He lived like the 
Congolese lived... in a rundown building without any comfort. He had a 
bathroom that hadn't seen a brush in ages,.. . It struck us as a bit 
odd, but later we would understand that Frère Louis is one of these rare
 people that does not care about himself, but only about the others. We 
would meet Frère Louis later on this trip and everything would become 
clear then.<br>

He was well organized though. He was the only one in town with transportation<br>

He uses this truck to get supplies from Lubumbashi to all of the project
 he is running in the area. The big wheels, the portle axles and the 
huge winch make it a capable bundybasher. It is expensive to run (fuel) 
so it does not see much action. He had two of these.. but one was

<br>
<br>
The bridges were something we were very concerned about upfront. Congo 
has a lot streams and rivers and we knew the roads had not seen 
maintenance in many many years. If a bridge broke down, that could be a 
major problems. Up until now however we did not have any problems with 
the bridges. Some of the smaller bridges might have been dodgy, but all 
of them were passable. Most of the large bridges were fortunately made 
out of steel and in reasonably good nick. <br>
<br>
Take the bridge we just crossed for example. I find it amazing that is 
still there. Numerous armies have crossed the Congo in the last 20 
years, chasing their enemies down to the capital. Now, I am not a 
military expert, but if my army was losing terrain to the enemy army and
 I have to retreat. The one thing I would certainly do was blow up all 
bridges after me. Had it happened but was the damage so small that it 
could easily be repaired? Or did they just not bother? Or did they lack 
the explosives and time to actually blow it up? Who knows.... but at 
least the outcome is good for us now! <br>
<br>
After the bridge was a long climb on a hill. The road was filled with 
rocks the size of small cars. Josephine had to guide me trough in 1st 
gear low. Very technical driving.<br>
<br>
All of a sudden we hear somebody approaching. Running. He does not even 
look at us and speeds past us. A few seconds later another young guy 
speeds past us. We stop briefly to check out what is chasing them but 
cannot see anything.<br>
<br>
This is odd... very odd. Congolese man are strong and explosive. But the
 only time we've seen prove of their strength is when they are working. 
We had never seen a Congolese run... just for the fun of it. <br>
<br>
We continued slowly and started to get worried when more men hurried past us. Something was up.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Thanks for the motivating words guys! Appreciated.<br>
<br>
Here's more..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The efforts of the rocky 
climb were paid of with a beautiful view. We rarely had an overview of 
the landscape we were driving trough as there were walls of jungle on 
both sides of the roads. Luena can be seen below. <br>

<br>
At the bottom of the hill, were water would accumulate, there was a 
boghole. The "runners" were there too. We could have guessed it. They 
looked happy.<br>
<br>
We gave them a hello and started exploring the possibilities. There were
 3 routes that could lead trough the hole. The runners were quick to 
point out that we had to take the rightmost route. They claimed it was 
the best route and we would have no problems going trough there.<br>
<br>
We did not even try to walk it, it was obviously the worst of the three 
options. Driving in there would mean we would get stuck. Not for hours, 
but for days.<br>
We ignored their "advice" and started wading trough the other two 
options. The middle route had water up to chest height, but the 
underground was relatively solid. The left route was very muddy. It was 
not a very long patch of mud but we would have to drive on an angle and 
risked sliding sideways in the deep water. A tree was seperating the 
middle and the left route. Left seemed like the best way to go.<br>
<br>
Once we made intentions to clear the left route of sticks one of the 
runners got really angry. His face turned red and he shouted. he was 
really upset that we did not ask them to help us. After all, "we were 
rich and we could pay them to help us trough". <br>
<br>
We asked him why he was so surprised that we did not want to trust him 
with the duty of helping us trough after they had clearly given us false
 advice at first.<br>
<br>
The "runner" now got really upset and shouted even louder, gesticulating
 wildly. He seemed so convinced that we did wrong to him that we thought
 he was about to start fighting with us. He threw a whole lot of 
arguments at us that did not make sense at all. This was nothing short 
of extortion. This is how corruption crept into normal life here. These 
were not officials making abuse of their power, this was a normal guy 
who wanted a piece of the cake that he strongly believed was his.<br>
<br>
We got really mad at everything he said, but did not react. We were not 
in a position to make enemies there. The obstacle ahead of us made it 
quite likely that we would get ourselves stuck. We needed friends, not 
enemies. But we don't pay people to be our friends. <br>
<br>
We chanced it. Josephine walked across first and gave me directions. I 
slowly entered the mudpit in 1st low and creeped forward. There was very
 little traction and I started to slide sideways into the deep water.<br>
<br>
In a normal situation, this would the point that you stop, and reverse 
out again. And then try to build a dam to stop you sliding sideways and 
try again. But I could feel the the eyes of the angry runner in my back.
 I wanted to get out of here. Now!<br>
<br>
I floored it. Mud flying everywhere. Sliding sideways I made it far 
enough not to slide in the deep water but hit the tree in the middle 
hard on the side of the car. The tree kept us upright and we plowed 
trough.<br>
<br>
I could feel my hart beating wildly. Adrenaline pumping trough my veins.
 Josephine hopped in the car and we drove off. She was equally pumped up
 and we roared out our excitement. We couldn't care less about the dent.<br>
<br>
We didn't look back at the runners when we dissapeared in the jungle.<br>
<br>
How did a simple obstacle like this become such a nerve wrecking experience?</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-4-1587032527" data-lb-id="_xfUid-4-1587032527">

The goal for this day was Kamina. The central Franciscan mission for the
 Katange provice is there. Progress was slow but no major problems were 
had.<br>
<br>
Most of the road lead trough dense jungle. Great for a short while, but 
it's not like you get a chance to enjoy the scenery. We passed many 
bogholes and had to be on the constant lookout of obstacles.<br>

In the dense forest we often bumped into things. We accumulated small 
dents. Our bullbar also took a good hit when drove into a cut off tree  
that was hidden in the bushes.<br>

traffic. Everything is done by train or air. Trucks are sometimes used 
to transport goods to area that are further away of the railline. They 
usually run on a fixed traject between settlements. They never venture 
further.<br>
<br>
It is also a seasonal activity. They drive until the rainy season starts and the roads become impossible.<br>
<br>
This was the start of the rainy season. We came across a stuck truck 
(can you see the constant here... every vehicle we pass is stuck  :wink:
  ). They were offloading the load onto bicycles. There are very few 
trucks here, and none of them wanted to take the risk to pull him out 
now that the rainy season had started. The truck would be here for 
several months until the mudpit he was in would dry out.<br>
<br>
Upon seeing us they got a bit excited and asked for all sorts of things.
 Whiskey and mobile phones mostly. That was a welcome (?) change from 
the usual demands for "Un jus" or money. They also asked for water and 
we poured water from our own bottles into their bottles. We had to throw
 away our bottles afterwards because of the horrible smell of cheap 
whiskey that came out ouf their bottles.<br>

We rolled into Kamina and had a warm welcome by several "frères" 
(Brothers), among them Frère Louis, the belgian brother that hosted us 
in Luena. The other frères were Croatian. They all have their missions 
deep in the brousse, but this week they had their annual gettogether.<br>
<br>
The missions was big and well organized. They had all the facilities, 
even a workshop. They were responsible for almost everything functional 
in Kamina. Churches, school, farms, factories, ... <br>
<br>
They had several trucks and each brother had his own 4x4 to sevice their
 mission. In these circumstance only 1 vehicle is considered.<br>

the engine we could hear the batteries were having a hard time turning 
around the starter motor. Upon checking we noticed that the alternator 
was shot. The batteries would have 1 or 2 more starts in it, but then it
 would be finished.<br>
<br>
This couldn't have happened in a better place ofcourse. The mechanics 
from the missions dismantled the alternator and found the brushes to be 
worn down. Spares were ofcourse not at hand, but they found an 
alternator from a broken down hilux and used those brushes. It worked 
perfectly.<br>

The guys in the workshop were really friendly and extremely proud of their jobs. Nice people!<br>
<br>
We felt like we were in heaven at the mission. Everybody was friendly, 
we had the opportunity to take our first shower since leaving 
Lubumbashi. And they had beer! Yeah!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"> <br>

That night we talked for hours with Frère Louis. Our little adventures 
here dissapear in the nothing compared to everything he went trough. He 
had been in DRC for over 40 years, he stayed during all the wars. He had
 to abandon everything and run for his live three times as teams were 
sent out to kill him. But he always returned. Many books could be filled
 with his adventures.<br>
<br>
He is also responsible for most of the bridges Katanga. He build  
hundreds of bridges himself. He has a small working budget from 
Franciscans, but he funds most of it all by himself. He has put every 
last penny in the Congolese people. That is why his house in Luena was 
so rundown.<br>
<br>
He also told us about the Mayi-Mayi rebels that still roam the jungle. 
We were not prepared for the horror stories we would hear. I still have 
problems giving these stories a place. They are not just stories though,
 he gave us a 100 page document with his interviews of victims. If you 
thought, like us, that cannibalism was something that belonged in comic 
books and dusty museums about Africa. You are wrong. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite15" alt=":cry:" title="Crying    :cry:" data-shortname=":cry:"><br>

 did not read this post. It contains background information on DRC but 
it is pretty horrific to read and not for the faint hearted.<br>

<br>
So, some excerpts out the witness stories Frère Louis gathered. The 
reports are mixed in Dutch and French. I will quote them and (freely) 
translate into English, apologies if I make mistakes. I removed the

I just selected some random pages of the 131 page long document and 
copied these excerpt. It is an endless accumulation of horror witness 
reports. All of this happened on a large scale, and only covers the area
 where Frére Louis operates in.<br>
<br>
When the war ended (+- 2002) most of these activities stopped in this 
area. The May-may retreated north where they are still operational (the 
East Congo drama... still going on).<br>
<br>
These things were regularly going on until 2 years before we drove 
trough the area. It was still very fresh in the memory of everybody we 
must have met on the road. This also explains the huge amount of orphans
 in these areas.<br>
<br>
--<br>
<br>
Let's put this in a bit of perspective: Frère Louis told us some of 
these stories while we were sitting in the comforts of the Kamina 
mission. He told the stories as if it was a daily occurance.. and that 
was actually the case indeed. At that moment we were shocked, but 
thought this was something of the (distant) past.  And it was - at least
 in this area. It is only until after the trip, when we started reading 
his document, that we started to comprehend the large scale of the 
massacres that had been going on here.<br>
<br>
We were here in 2008. The last reports of cannibalism in this area were from 2006.<br>
<br>
All of the people we met in the DRC must have been confronted, one way or another, with these horrible events.<br>
<br>
I never heard anything about this in the international news</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Damn,
 I made a mistake in my report and skipped a day. Apologies. After our 
little ordeal with the "runners" we actually struggled on until we 
reached Kabondo Dianda. <br>
<br>
So, Our progress after day 5 was:<br>

<b>Day 8</b><br>
Our stay in the mission in Kamina was really great. We got our 
alternator fixed, had great conversations with the brothers, drank as 
much beer as we wanted and had some good food. We even managed to dry 
out our tent.<br>
<br>
When we wanted to leave we wanted to pay for the repairs, the 
accomodation and the beer but they refused. They were so happy to have 
visitors. Genuinely great people, the fathers Franciscan at Kamina. They
 have my greatest respect!<br>
<br>
We were invited to join breakfast and received lots and lots of 
information on the roads that we would be taking in the next days. They 
never drive all the way to Kananga (next big town), but they know all 
the roads and backroads in the area. Not surprising, as most of them 
were built by them.<br>
<br>
It's funny how a brother in a white gown explains the best way how to 
take certain obstacles and which gears to use. They must have been one 
of the most experienced 4x4 drivers in Africa!<br>

We approached another big farm(ranch?). The Route National went around 
the farm but was in a horrible state. The farm had a network of 
excellent dirt roads that could bypass a large part of the RN1. We were 
stopped at a "toll booth" but upon mentioning that we were friends of 
the Fathers we can pass for free.<br>
<br>
We travel fast now, great little sandy tracks trough the steppe. Yihaa!<br>
<br>
Until we reach the next obstacle... one we did not expect!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1587032538" data-lb-id="_xfUid-1-1587032538">

<br>
<br>
I can see you thinking... what the * is that?<br>
<br>
That were pretty much our thoughts too. We were still on the private 
roads of the farm. The alternative, the RN1, was really horrible, so 
whomever needed to pass trough here preferred to take the private roads,
 even if that meant paying a fee. But the farm wanted to prevent trucks 
from taking their roads, as they erode the sandy tracks and destroy 
them.<br>
<br>
The road led trough a large marsh and spot in the middle they build that
 "thing". It was about 2,4meter high. Great way of preventing trucks 
from passing. But with our rooftop tent on we were about 2,6meter high.<br>
<br>

Tough luck...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">It was midday. The sun was
 particularely fierce today and we had little shade. Returning to the 
RN1 was not really an option for us. We checked out the area and driving
 around it was no option either.<br>
<br>
We started by digging into the ground underneath the construction. It 
was well thought out as the base was a metal plate. We cleared the plate
 of all ground... another 5mm won  :roll: <br>
<br>
The tyres were let down to 0,5 bar but we were still too high. We opened the rooftoptent and removed the mattres, pillows, ... .<br>
<br>

<br>
The front cleared now, but the back of the car was still too high. We 
let out all of the remaining air out of tyres (0bar)... still no go  :? <br>
<br>
So I climbed on the roof and Josephine took the wheel. We counted to 
three and I jumped on the roof while Josephine moved forward for a few 
centimeter at a time. And counted to 3 again, etc... It scraped a bit, 
but it worked.<br>

<br>
Once we passed we got the compressor out to inflate the tyres again. I really did not want to damage the tyres here! <br>
<br>
First tyre, Ok, switches the hose to the second tyre and then *poof* the compressor died.   :tantrum: <br>
<br>
These kind of things really eat at you. Patience is virtue, but when you
 are trying to move forward so desperately you really don't want a 
compressor to die! <br>
<br>
Checked the fuse, checked cabling, checked overheat protection. 
Everything look allright?? This is the moment were you kick a tree (it 
hurts) out of frustration. We had three flat tyres and we only had two 
spares. We needed that compressor!<br>
<br>
So in the midday heat I started to dismantle the compressor. The 
compressor was bolted on the roof, so I had to work on the roof... no 
shade there..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The problem with the 
compressor was electrical. A cable inside the compressor worked itself 
loose. As expected it was that one cable that is almost impossible to 
reach.  :twisted:  Eventually we got it fixed, managed to inflate the 
tyres, put everything in the RTT again and we could continue. <br>
<br>
3 hours wasted to cross an obstacle that isn't supposed to be an 
obstacle...  :O Of all the problems we had in Congo, this was the most 
ridiculous one  :roll:<br>

We continued trough grassy fields.... which were on fire!  8O <br>
At the beginning of the rainy season/ end of the harvest they burn their
 fields but they did have some issues with the firecontrol I must say. 
We were just hoping that we wouldn't drive straight into a fire. For the
 next hours we saw nothing at all really...<br>

Upon arrival in 'his' village all of the children ran to meet us. They 
sang and danced. What a welcome! Although I wished they wouldn't have 
danced on our wheelcarrier...  :roll: <br>
<br>
A big crowd followed us trough the village and onto the mission. Father 
Stoïn must have been a popular guy. We did our talks with the village 
people (happy people!) and were already getting scared that this would 
once again be one of those zero-privacy nights. Father Stoïn had given 
us a letter for Jean-Marie, the 'housekeeper' of the mission. It was a 
multi page letter, probably with all kinds of instructions. One of these
 instructions must have been that we were to be left alone. Jean Marie 
talked to the crowd and told them that we were very tired and needed 
rest. The crowd accepted that and went home.<br>
<br>
We parked our car in the compound of the mission, with a beautiful view over the hilly landscape. <br>
<br>
For the first time since we entered Congo we had a night for ourselves. 
We cooked up an improvised spagetti and opened up one of our 'emergency 
beers'. God, what a magnificently beautiful place this was. Complete 
with the sound of drums in the distance.<br>
<br>
Father Stoïn, you have our eternal gratitude!<br>

<br>
Today would be a bit of a step into the unknown. Until now we were still
 in the Katanga province, we had excellent contacst with the Franciscans
 that operate here, but they do not operate in the Kasai province. Also,
 the only person we had found that had travelled these road was an 
Israeli guy wo attempted to cross Congo a few years ago. He got arrested
 at the border between Katanga and Kasai because he did not have a 
permit and got deported. He had to fly out from Mbuji Mayi.<br>
<br>
Today we too would cross the border into Kasai. We only had a vague 
contact in Mbuji-Mayi, but nothing in between here and Mbuji-Mayi, and 
nothing afterwards either as a matter of fact.<br>
<br>
This made us a bit more nervous as usual I must say...<br>
<br>
The deeper we got into Congo, the less traffic there was. It's been days
 since we saw another vehicle on the road. Roads were getting more and 
more overgrown.<br>

You cannot tell from this picture, but the iron beam underneath the iron
 plate was broken in two. We had to drive next to the plate. On the far 
side this meant we only had half a tyre on the bridge.<br>
<br>
We were a well oiled team by now. The procedure was always the same. We 
both got out to inspect the bridge and decide on a traject. Josephine 
would give directions and I drove over. It usually took no longer then 
15 minutes. In most cases we did not bother taking pictures, a shame 
because there we some beauties of bridges there ;-)<br>
<br>
All in all we were very happy with the bridges we encountered as most 
were made of steel. We still had some bad memories from the wooden 
bridges in the 'other' Congo (Congo-Brazzavile) when we crashed trough a
 bridge last year<br>

At one of the "flaque d'eau" I think it is not necessary to walk it 
first. I drive in with a bit of speed and our right side sinks away 
deeply. Water came in via the right window and the left wheels were of 
the ground, spinning wildly and giving us a mud shower trough the left 
window. I have the good reflex to steer into the pit.. we barely manage 
to stay upright. The interior of our car, ourselves included, are 
covered in mud. Great!<br>
<br>
It was getting late and we started making mistakes again... time to stop
 before it gets dark. We did not make it into Kasai province today after
 all...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We stopped in the first village.
 A car in the village.. with white people in it. Now that is an 
attraction ofcourse. And if they are covered in mud from head to toe it 
is even more interesting.<br>
<br>
I do not have to explain we drew a bit of a crowd?<br>
<br>
But people were actually quite nice. They offered us to use their shower
 (a tree with a mud wall before it and a bucket) and after an hour or so
 they actually left us alone.<br>
<br>
Later that evening some kind of custom officer came to see us. He wanted
 to see our permits and whatnot. We kindly told him to bugger off and 
come back tomorrow. Surprisingly, it worked. Next day we were gone 
before he came back ;-)<br>
<br>
As soon as it got dark we got into our tent and looked outside. We could
 see several fires in the village were people would gather around and 
sing and dance (mostly women). Small groups of men were having 
discussions. Peaceful village.<br>

<br>
The border of the Katange province and Kasai is at the Lubilanji river. A
 big river with a big bridge. We dare not take pictures here as "border"
 zones are considered of military importance and it is an excellent 
reason to get arrested.<br>
<br>
Surprisingly there is no checkpoint at the bridge... There is a hut, but
 it was not manned. Instead they seemed to have moved their checkpoint 
closer to their base a few kilometers down the road.<br>
<br>
It is a torough check. Police, Army, Customs, .. They check it all. 
Insurance, permit, etc... We manage to bluff us trough the permit issue 
again. When they run out of excuses to fine us, they just give up and 
plainly ask us for money. "Just because". We refuse ofcourse. It takes 
over an hour, we get angry a few times, we flatter them a few times, ...
 The usual. In the end they are angry but let us go.<br>
<br>
We were afraid of Kasai and their people. They have the reputation of 
being hot tempered people. But until now they seem to be much more 
relaxed then the people in Katanga.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">It's
 a long driving day again and when we finally arrive in Mwene-ditu we 
are knackered. We try to find a mission to stay in. Mwene-ditu is large 
city, it has cars and is an important stop on the railroad. It also 
feels like a very dodgy place.<br>
<br>
Some of the streets resamble an extreme 4x4 course. Extreme erosion mixed with open sewers. <br>
<br>
We manage to find a catholic missions that wants to take us in. We can 
park in their compound, but the street in front of their gate is eroded 
away. There is 3 meter level ground in front the gate and then a 3 meter
 deep pit. It takes a 1000turn manouvre to get us in. The roads simply 
aren't made for cars here. (They used to..)<br>
<br>
We have a few hours of daylight left and we get to check the car. The 
protective plate underneath the gearbox is badly dent and hanging half 
loose. A few extra dents and lots of scratches. Could be worse I guess. 
We also noted that we are starting to get low on fuel. With our 270liter
 onboard we hoped to do at least 1500km, that should have gotten us to 
Mbuji Mai were we were sure there was Diesel. It is only 120km to Mbuji 
Mayi from here, but with what we have it might be a close shave. Our 
consumption was in excess of 20l/100km.<br>
<br>
We do not want to risk it, so we try to buy some diesel here. We saw 
there was a big depot at the railroad. We ask for advice with the local 
father. He warns us that if we were to go ourselves, the prices would be
 at least double because of our white skin. He offers to buy it for us. 
We are a bit hesitant but we give him 80$US. That should buy us 40 
liters of diesel.<br>
<br>
The father dissapears for a few hours (!) and returns with two 20 liter 
jerrycans. He wanted to immediately pour it in our tanks but I wanted to
 check the diesel first. The smell was funny... not very diesel like. It
 had a red/brown colour and lots of debri. This was not diesel. It might
 contain a bit of diesel, but it was mixed with something else.<br>
<br>
This was a very difficult situation as we suspected the father to try to
 fool us into buying this stuff and making a buck. But at the same time 
he was our host. In the end we refused the "diesel" and he gave us back 
our money. But he did not return the jerrycans. A very strang situation.<br>
<br>
We did not feel at ease. Maybe we are starting to get paranoid?</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after Day 10. Mwene-Ditu<br>

<br>
When we are leaving Mwene-Ditu the next morning we are stopped by a 
manifestation. It is a burial. A body is carried in the front of the 
large group of people. Behind it are weeping women and shouting men. 
Some of the youngsters are pumped up and when they spot us they draw 
their attention to us. We are not sure why they were angry at us, but we
 did not stay around to ask them.<br>
<br>
We get stopped again at a police checkpoint. They ask us to pay the "Tax
 provincial". There is no such thing and we explain it them. They are 
the sleazy kind of police and our discussions are getting nowhere. They 
keep asking for money and make some discriminating comments towards us. 
After half an hour of this I lose it.<br>
<br>
"J'EN AI MARRE" - "I'VE HAD ENOUGH"<br>
<br>
I shout so loud that even Josephine looks scared at me. She would later 
tell me that my eyes had turned as red as my face and that I looked 
very, very dangerous. Complete and utter silence follows for a few 
minutes. After which one of the police officers asks me for money again.
 Luckily one of the other officers was more impresed by my shouting and 
had opened the gate. We blasted off.<br>
<br>
I was really starting to get sick of getting extorted by every one we met.<br>
<br>
I hadn't returned to normal before we were stopped again. This time it 
was a toll booth. The usual cadeaux/jus were asked to which I replied in
 a not so polite manner. The actual toll we had to pay. Foreigners had 
to pay 10 times the fee of the Congolese. I got out of the car and told 
them what I thought about corruption in Congo and why I thought nothing 
was working here. A 10 minute monologue. They were not impressed but I 
was happy I got it of my heart. We paid the stupid tax. It was an 
official thing and we got a receipt.<br>
<br>
Between Mwene-Ditu and Mbuji-Mayi there is an asphalt road!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" data-shortname=":D"> <br>

<br>
<br>
So, why is there an asphalt road in the middle of Congo? Not connected 
to the rest of the road system (due to lack of road system).<br>
<br>
There reason is simple: Diamonds. This is the main diamond center of 
Congo. This has attracted many people ofcourse, but the local people 
barely benefit of the natural wealth of the region. Officially it is the
 third largest city of Congo, after Kinshasa &amp; Lubumbashi. Although 
by now it is probably the second largest city with over 2 million 
inhabitants. It also a politically important region. Most of the recent 
political problems start here. When Mbuji-Mayi "explodes" the rest of 
the country usually follows shortly after.<br>
<br>
The diamong mining companies ofcourse need transport. Most is done via 
air, but the heavy supplies (fuel) are brought in by train. The nearest 
train station is in Mwene-Ditu. Hence the tar road between Mwene-Ditu 
and Mbuji-Mayi.<br>
<br>
It makes a great place to walk on... few cars in the area, so there is little traffic.<br>
<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">As mentioned before, problems in
 Congo usually start here, in Mbuji-Mayi. It has the reputation of  "une
 ville chaud" - "a hot town / a heated town". Were hot refers to both 
the climate, as to the atmosphere. Literally everybody we met told us to
 avoid the city if at all possible. It should be home to some of the 
worst police and is generally considered unsafe.<br>
<br>
It is true that the climate is really hot and sticky. Tropical climate at its best. The humidity seems to drive everybody nuts. <br>
<br>
But we needed fuel. Via the friends we made in Lubumbashi we had the 
phone number of a Belgian guy who works here in Mbuji-Mayi for CTB 
(Belgian aid). We don't know him, and he does not even know we exist.<br>
<br>
We gave him a call and explained the situation. He agreed to help us out
 and we were supposed to meet eachother a the filling station in the 
center of town.<br>
<br>
The atmosphere in Mbuji-Mayi is impossible to describe. It seems like 
nobody here has normal discussions. Only heated discussions. You can 
hear it in their voice, as if they are constantly angry at each other. 
We saw a few fights  when driving trough town. We negotiated a dozen or 
so police checks before we arrive at the Total filling station. It's the
 first real 'pump' we see since leaving Lubumbashi. We fill up and leave
 a staggering amount of cash behind (2$US/liter).<br>
<br>
10 minutes later a Landcruiser with a Mundele in it stops, we quickly 
shake hands and Christian quickly introduces himself. Equally quickly we
 drive off again. We follow him into the compound of CTB. They have a 
nice office here, with bathroom and all. Unfortunately the water system 
is down for two weeks now, so no water. Christian has a day off today 
and already made plans for the day, so he cannot stay with us. But we 
are free to camp in the compound and use their facilities. They have two
 "guardiens" (guards). Christians recommends us to stay inside.<br>
<br>
We are thirsty so we ignore Christian's advice and go out on foot to 
find us a cold beer. Plenty of bars here. It takes a bit of negotiating 
before they let us take the beer with us. It is in glass, and they need 
to recover the empty bottles. We have to pay a deposit and promise to 
bring the glass back.<br>
<br>
People who visited the Congo's will surely recognize the "Skol' brand. 
Not a bad beer actually. There is a brewery in Mbujy-Mayi and only the 
beers that are brewed here have the diamond in the logo. <br>

That night we lay in our tent, looking at the stars and listening to the
 sound of the city. It does not sound like any other city at night. We 
hear heated discussions and a few fights. Also some gun shots.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 11. Mbuji-Mayi<br>

<br>
We did not want to end up in the wrong place at the wrong time when 
leaving Mbuji-Mayi. As "the wrong time" takes about whole day long here,
 we ask one of the guardiens at CTB to guide us out of town. The road to
 Kananga, our goal for this day, is not really connected to the city. 
The neverending expension of Mbuji-Mayi has swallowed the road and now 
one has to drive trough the kilometers of shacks to get to city end.<br>
<br>
Once again we are asked to pay toll, we do not complain too much this 
time as the previous toll had brought us a nice tar road. Not so this 
time. The road was not horrible, but it was not exactly good either. It 
certainly wasn't maintained. The scenery on the other hand was stunning.
 It was great to finally see a bit around us as we were usually stuck in
 dense jungle or high grass.<br>

This happened very recently. People there pointed us to a detour. We had
 to take bicycle tracks all the way to Kamwanda  (+- 30km) where there

It was getting late already and we were not sure if we would make it to 
Kananga today. Depending on the state of the bicycle tracks, we would 
have to stay in a village again.<br>
<br>
The first village we encountered seemed deserted at first, but as soon 
as we entered the village we saw people coming at us from all sides. 
They had machetes and sticks and were shouting. "Des Blancs. Argent!" - 
"White people. Money!". They were all over the place. This was not good!
 I floored it and sped out of the village. A rock hit the back of our 
car.<br>
<br>
What in gods name was that all about?<br>
<br>
Very few Congolese had made us feel welcome, but this was plain agression! It scared the hell out of us.<br>
<br>
We passed another village, and once again a mob formed as soon as they 
heard us coming. Machetes flying round, racist slogans shanted. Once 
again we did not give them the chance to get near us and blasted out of 
the village. They tried following us. This was turning ugly, if we would
 get stuck here we would be in big trouble, these people did not want a 
chat!<br>
<br>
With half an hour of daylight left we knew we had a problem. We tried 
sending our coordinates to the homefront with the instructions to call 
the embassy if they did not hear from us within the hour. Despite us 
having bought SIM cards of the two major GSM operators, we did not have 
reception.<br>
<br>
With our hearts racing we neared another village.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Once

</blockquote>So-so. The initial nervousness when entering Congo remained
 with us for the rest of our trip. We were hoping it would go away as it
 always did before but it didn't. It is a great feeling not knowing what
 you are up to next, but up until now almost all of the 'surprises' were
 not so pleasant. The anticipation for the next 'bad' thing to happen 
made sure that our adrenaline levels were always high.<br>
<br>
In Josephine's case that resulted in a sort of insomnia. She really 
slept bad all trough Congo. Always on the lookout I guess. Our leaking 
tent did not help either.<br>
<br>
In my case it resulted in a lack of apetite. My stomach felt like I was 
desperatly in love. I really had to force myself to eat something.<br>
<br>
In both our cases this meant we were getting physically exhausted. <br>

I just reread the report and I am a bit embarrased about the amount 
spelling mistakes and typo's. I can do a better job. I make these 
reports during breaks at work or in between other things, so it's always
 a quick write-up and I post it immediately, without spellchecking.

</blockquote>I presume you are referring to the "not so nice" role 
Belgium has had in the history of Congo. For a while I thought that 
would be a problem as well, but it isn't. Just about anything that still
 exists in Congo is made by the Belgians. The older generation who had 
their education from the Belgians really have fond memories of that era.
 And at the moment Belgium is still one of the main funders of the 
country (via aid). The dark pages of history during the Leopold 2 era is
 not what the Congolese people think about. All in all I think being 
Belgian was actually a plus. As a matter of fact, a lot of people asked 
how things were going with the "war" in Belgium :-o<br>

was pobably a lot better. Nothing constructive happened since the 80's. I
 would have loved to see the country then. And even more so in 50's when
 it must have been really easy (relative) to travel in the country.<br>

<br>
When this report is done I will post some aftertoughts about the various aspects of this trip.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Now seems like a good time to pause the report  :twisted:  and have a little flashback to the period before we entered the DRC.<br>
<br>
We made the decision to tackle this part of DRC when we were in Egypt. 
It would take us about 4 months to drive from Cairo down to the 
Zambia/DRC border. We immediately started our quest for information. It 
would soon become clear that very little information was available. We 
did not know of a single traveller that did this traject in the lat 20 
years. We knew of two who tried (both on motorbikes) in recent years. 
One crashed after a few days and got evacuated. The other got arrested 
and deported. Both didn't get very far. <br>
<br>
So we had to be creative and think of other sources of information. A 
small overview of some of the responses we received from different 
instances we contacted<br>
<br>
1) MONUC. The UN mission in DRC (<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Congo" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/forum/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FUnited_Nations_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Congo&amp;hash=691dbd48dc8567d511dcfe1f97f16e18" rel="nofollow noopener">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_Nations_Mission_in_the_Democratic_Republic_of_Congo</a>
 ). They have almost 20.000 people on the ground, they must have some 
information. Actualy their website has some useful information.<br>
<br>
We contacted the "Cellule Infrastructure" and received the following reply (excerpts):<br>

We still haven't reached the Loange river... great prospect ;-)<br>

</blockquote>"Certain parts are infested with 'coupeurs de route' (<a href="http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupeur_de_route" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/forum/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Ffr.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FCoupeur_de_route&amp;hash=08430a181299fcc8186c184731912732" rel="nofollow noopener">http://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coupeur_de_route</a>), especially the following parts: Likasi-Kolwezi and Tshikapa-Kananga"<br>
<br>
These 'Coupeurs de route' are lawless gangs. 'Road bandits'. They have a
 nasty reputation in that they have little value for human life. Rape is
 a common working method for them.<br>
<br>
These people I wanted to avoid. On the other hand, one has to read 
between the lines here, and it was pretty obvious to me: monuc did not 
have a clue what was going on in the area. They just did not have 
reliable and up to date information. Do note that monuc is mostly active
 in East Congo (Goma, Kisangani,..) not in the more 'stable' 
south/south-west were we are travelling trough.<br>
<br>
2) Coca-cola company: If there is ony thing you can find anywhere in the
 world it is Coca-Cola. They should know how to get their goods in the 
country. We had no response on mails, so we called them up. Their answer
 was pretty short: They do not have a distribution network outside the 
major cities in Congo  8O And it proved to be true, Congo is the first 
country we have visited were Coca-cola is hard to get once you leave the
 major cities.<br>
<br>
3) About a dozen of NGO's, all answers were negative: they did not have any information<br>
<br>
4) Journalists from press agencies and the author from the only 
guidebooks that exists on the DRC (Sean Rorison): We received a few 
interesting adresses and contacts in cities, but nothing on the roads. 
They only travel by air. From a few journalist we received warning on 
recent events of aggressive attacke by "coupeurs de route" in the area 
between Kananga and Tshikapa.<br>
<br>
5) Foreign affairs office of our own country and several other countries
 (US, France, ..): they told us we would die if we only thought about 
the DRC ;-)<br>
<br>
6) The Congolese "Office des routes". I was not expecting an answer from
 them, but they did reply! From a personal mailadres somebody from the 
Congolese ministry told me that they had no information whatsoever on 
the condition of their road network. But they would appreciate any 
information that we could obtain! <br>
<br>
The moral of the story was: nobody knew anything about the road 
conditions. The worrying bit were the "coupeurs de route". Different 
sources talked about them, and always in the Kananga-Tshikapi area. This
 seemed like the area to avoid. We had already decided to drive to 
Kananga but then go north from there to Ilebo as to avoid the 
Kananga-Tshikapi area.<br>
<br>
In my last post I told we had to make a detour because a bridge was out. Guess in what area that brought us?</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><i>With our hearts racing we neared another village.</i><br>
<br>
We tried to sneak in the village but failed miserably. Same thing 
happened again, confused looks at first, as soon as they saw us they 
shouted at eachother and then came storming after us.<br>
<br>
What did we do to these people that they wanted us so badly?<br>
<br>
Like thieves in the night we raced trough the bush and stopped as soon 
as we had cell phone reception. We sent our coordinates home and called 
our Belgian friends in Lubumbashi to see if they could give us a contact
 in Kananga. They responded quickly (Thanks Valérie!) with a phone 
number of the "procure" (mission) in Kananga. But no answer there... :-(<br>
<br>
From what we saw on the GPS it would be at least another 2 hours before 
we would arrive in Kananga. It was getting really dark by now. We had no
 choice, we had to reach Kananga!<br>
<br>
These were some of the scariest moments in my life. Everybody we crossed
 here was mad at us. We sent our coordinates to the home front every 10 
minutes or so. <br>
<br>
Relentlesly we continued. It got pitch dark and the road was really 
difficult. We could not afford to make mistakes now, but we also did not
 feel like getting out of the car to inspect any obstacles. The dark was
 actually good for us as people would not see that we are white. This 
seemed to make a major difference in the reaction of the people.<br>
<br>
But we made it. We were so happy to reach Kananga and at the same time 
scared to death that people would react the same here. Fortunately the 
town was quiet and actually looked friendly in the moonlight. Due to 
pure luck we drove straight into the compound of the procure and at that
 into safety.<br>
<br>
The friendly father-abt allowed us to camp in the garden. He looked 
genuinely surprised if we told him about our bad experience but at the 
same time it was as if he was avoiding the subject too.<br>
<br>
We put up the tent, got out our chairs and opened one of our "emergency 
beers". We just sat there a long time without saying a word to 
eachother. The sky was beautiful and the sounds of all the insects was 
magnificent.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">So, what was that all about?<br>
<br>
In all honesty, we don't have a clue! I only know that this ranks very 
high in my top 10 scariest moments. Everybody has their limits, well 
this was over mine. I do not want this to happen to me again.<br>
<br>
- Where we just panicking for no reason, paranoid by all the 
(mis)information we received? Did we create the danger in our minds?<br>
<br>
Maybe, I really can't tell. We discussed this afterwards, and we did not
 make up those mobs that charged at us. They had machetes. They did 
chase us. <br>
<br>
We have a few theories though:<br>
<br>
- These villages were on a newly created "detour". Normally no motorized
 traffic would pass trough here. Bicycles only. Maybe they saw this as 
new way to generate money, and they wanted their part of the cake. 
Although somebody should explain to them that this is not a good way to 
ask for a toll fee.<br>
<br>
- We had the feeling that they were focussing on us, not only because we
 were in a vehicle, but because of our skin color. Did a white person do
 something wrong here? Where they trying to seek vengeance? I wouldn't 
surprise me if a white person in car ran somebody over, or destroyed 
something and then fled away.<br>
<br>
- Some fetish reason. Witchdoctors have a lot of influence here. If they
 had casted a spell of some sorts. Or predicted that something bad would
 happend if a white person would pass trough here.<br>
<br>
- ...<br>
<br>
I guess we will never know.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 12. Kananga<br>

<br>
This was the half way point and up until now we at least had minimal 
information on what was ahead of us. That would end here. The only thing
 we knew was that the bac (ferry) at Tshikapa was not working - 
confirmed here in Kananga - and that the road to Tshikipa was not only 
suspect for "coupeurs de route" but also in a horrible state (mud!).<br>
<br>
The alternative was to go north from here to Ilebo were apparantly there
 was a ferry. And worst case we could try to put the car on a boat on 
the Congo river to Kinshasa. Nobody here in Kananga had gone all the way
 to Ilebo by car. Until about halfway there were some missions, but they
 were considered 'cut off' due to the state of the roads. Especially the
 last part of the road into Ilebo was said to be impossible.<br>
<br>
But most of it was hearsay anyway. People don't travel much overland here.<br>
<br>
We were halfway and it looked like what we just did was the easy part... <br>
<br>
Yesterday's events had gotten us exhausted and we decided to stay for a 
day in the safetey of the procure. We tried to get some sleep and do 
some cleaning up in the car. I also had to tape/bolt various bits and 
pieces back to the car.<br>
<br>

Staying at the procure also gave us the opportunity to meet some 
interesting people. They also had their own radio station. Because they 
had a huge antenna this was one of the most important radio stations in 
the area. For a lot of people the radio was their only means of 
information from the outside world. They were well equipped and the 
radio crew was young and extremely motivated.<br>
<br>
They did an interview with us, but we asked them not to air the 
interview immediately but instead wait 4 days. If it would be aired 
immediately it would be a matter of minutes before the entire police 
force came for their "share". Also with yesterdays events in the back of
 our mind, we wanted to keep the aspect of surprise.<br>

Up to 600kg of goods are transported on these bicycles. They do not

This is the major transport method in Congo. It is probably one of the 
most 'popular' (this does not seem like a good wordchoice) jobs. There 
are fixed routes and people often travel in groups. For security reasons
 but also to help eachother on the hills. <br>

stations". This is usualy a small hut where one can eat a meal of fufu. 
They would also have a pump and some basic tools to fix flats.<br>
<br>
We saw many of these overloaded bicycles before, but on this stretch of 
the road it seems to be the only means of transportation.<br>
<br>
It must be very hard work to get these loads over the sometimes very 
rough roads. The 'drivers' are away from home for weeks on end and 
probably barely make any money out of it.<br>
<br>
We never had problems with these guys, they were much to busy with their job.<br>

</blockquote>Until now we mostly followed the Route National 1, which 
used to be a real road (dirt). Although some of the original parts 
probably no longer exists. Detours ar formed when the road gets 
impassible and sometimes the detours then become the main road. The only
 railway they even built here still exists and connects Kananga and 
Lubumbashi. I think train rails just made for a convenient building 
material. Many of the bridges have been fairly recently (20 years ago?) 
rebuilt by the missions.<br>
<br>
So no, I do not think these road we rail road beds.<br>

</blockquote>Afterwards we heard that Frederik's mom and dad followed 
our progress on Google Earth in real time. The idea that somebody knew 
where we were was a relief to us.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We 
were pretty optimistic and hoped to reach Ilebo in two days. That meant 
that on the first day we had to make it to Pembeyangu, were we knew of a
 mission.<br>
<br>
Bicycle tracks are not suited for Landcruisers... so we got stuck. The 
villages usually had the worst obstacles. In this one village there was a
 big boghole filled with water. We drove in but did not see the pigs 
that were taking a bath so we slowed down to give them the time to get 
out.<br>
<br>
Big mistake. We were stuck. The water came to the bottom of the door. 
This particular mudpit had a bit of a funny smell. It was the favourite 
place of the pigs so it probably contained a fair amount of sh*t. It 
sure smelled like it. The entire village gathered round us while we got 
out, knee deep in sh*t.<br>
<br>
They did not offer help.<br>
<br>
We started clearing the wheels. Josephine hurt her foot on a stick, the 
pain could be seen on her face. The people thought this was extremely 
funny and burst out laughing. This was very humiliating for Josephine 
and I could see the anger on her face. We looked at eachother and 
understood that this was not the time to get angry or start discussions 
with 50 or so people. We continued to work. As I bend over to clear the 
mud from underneath the car my pants get wet up until my ehrm.. 
'privates'.. . Once again this is the funniest thing these people have 
ever seen. Hilarity ensues. This was very humiliating to us.<br>
<br>
Eventually they offered to help us if we pay them. I tell them that I do not have money. They did not move an inch.<br>
<br>
It takes the best part of an hour to get us out. To their surprise we 
stop again and I get out and walk up to them. Very calmly I explain that
 we did not like it when they laughed at us. I asked them how they would
 react if they hurt themselves and we would laugh at them. The 
acknowledged that they would get mad at us.<br>
I asked them if they would want us to help them if they had a problem. 
The acknowledged this. I said what they would think if we asked for 
money before we would help them. They called us racists and immediately 
demanded money from us.<br>
<br>
I then saw a side of Josephine I hadn't seen before. She got very cross 
with words and gestures. I will not repeat what she said here... it 
wasn't pretty I must say  8O Much to the amusement of our adience.<br>
<br>
To some of the people in the village our message must have gotten along, and they guided us around the next boghole. <br>
<br>
Half an hour later we stopped to eat lunch. We were still shaking after the humiliation, we felt helpess.<br>
We opened a can of Coke (still from Zambia) and a jar of pickled onions to eat with our bread.<br>
<br>
Those 'horrible' people did not have a Coke, even if they had the money 
to buy it, it was not avaialble. They did not have pickled onions 
either. And between the two of us we ate as much bread as an entire 
family would eat for an entire day.<br>
<br>
We tried putting things into perspective. Maybe we shouldn't be here after all?<br>

This was the thoughest going we had thus far since we left Lubumbashi. 
While the road had always been difficult, the inbetween bits used to be 
ok. Those inbetween bits did no longer exist now. The erosian was pretty

</blockquote>That is what we did when possible. But we did not take 
pictures of that ;-) Often the jungle was to dense, or the ridges to 
steep to drive around obstacles. We tried to avoid obstacles as much as 
possible.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">In a fast pace the clouds 
appeared out of nowhere, in a matter of minutes it became as dark as the
 night. Winds picked up and jungle forest made terrible noise. Thick 
drops started banging on our car. Slowly at first but exponentially 
growing in size and number. Lightning almost immediately followed by 
deafening thunder. The hard rain stirred the ground and released many 
smells.<br>
<br>
God, I love those tropical storms! A little less today though, as the 
track we were driving on quickly became very mudy. The ruts filled with 
water and became streams. Visibility was down to nil as our windscreen 
wipers couldn't keep up.<br>
<br>
This slowed us down even more. We slid and slide.. sideways more then forward.<br>
<br>
We came to another village, refreshingly we had the road for us alone, 
as everybody had taken cover for the rain. The usual bogholes were 
present but we could drive around it... or could we?<br>
<br>
What looked like a viable bypass was nothing more then a meter thick 
layer of soft and sticky mud on top of a puddle. Our landcruiser sunk in
 deep.<br>
<br>
I got out and within seconds I was drenched, I could barely breath 
because of the water that ran down my face and into my mouth. This was 
useless I couldn't see a thing. We had to wait until the rain stopped.<br>
<br>
Luckily those tropical storms go as quickyl as they come and after an 
half hour wait the downpour transformed in a little drizzle.<br>
<br>
We have gotten ourselves properly stuck I must say. Up unto the axles. 
Out came the sandplates and the shovels and I started digging. The 
village too had noticed the rain had resided and quickly came to see 
what was going on.<br>

No surprisingly nobody they offered their assistance, they even had some
 shovels. But they wanted money first. By now you probably think we are 
just stupidly stubborn and naive. We probably are, but we refused to 
give in to corruption. I once again told them they were free to help, 
but we would not give them money. So I continued to dig on my own with 
an entire village as an audience.<br>

It took three more attempts to drive out before the village priest (7th 
day Adventist by the way) encouraged a few strong men to help. After a 
small discussion between the priest and the men they helped us 
eventually. We did not promise them anything. Good!<br>
<br>
Almost two hours after we drove in we succesfully managed to back out. 
The priest then lead us trough his village (milimeterwork between the 
huts) around the bogholes.<br>
<br>
We offered the priest a small fee for his spontaneous help. We were 
grateful. He was in trouble now as he had to split up the money between 
the helpers and we could see a discussion had started already.<br>
<br>
Covered in mud we continued... the hope to get to Pembeyanga today has long vanished. Darkness was starting to fall...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 were a in a miserable state. We were both soaked and there was mud 
everywhere, exhausted and stirred by todays experiences. Hungry. And 
above all nervous as to where we would stop for the night. We passed a 
few villages, they looked very poor and rundown. On the GPS we saw we 
were nearing a somwhat larger settlement: Kakenge. In the dark we did 
another 5km (about an hour).<br>
<br>
Kakenge was indeed a large settlement and our luck turned as not only 
was there a catholic mission, it was a nice catholic mission! A fenced 
of compound (2 meter high walls.. who were they trying to keep out?) 
with inside a beautiful garden and two simple but clean buildings. The 
only brick buildings in town. Four fathers lived here, all Congolese but
 most of them had studied abroad. One of the fathers, Frère Polydore, 
had lived in Rome for 8 years. He had the humour and the way of talking 
of an Italian, a funny guy. They let us camp, have a shower (bucket) and
 they even let us use their dining room in all peacefulness.<br>
<br>
Just what we needed! Today we spent 15 hours on the road in our struggle forward. What a day...<br>
<br>
They also gave us the news that the road to Ilebo would progressively get worse and even impassable...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 14. Kakenge<br>

A winch can be handy, but there is always an alternative. Sometimes it meant it takes days to get out, instead of minutes.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 had been driving in akward angles a lot, and a few times already we 
could feel two wheels lifting off, but until now we managed to always 
end up on our 4 wheels. Until now..<br>
<br>
We had two wheels in the air and we were resting on our side. Luckily 
the eroded sidewall made sure we did not fall too deep. We knew it would
 happen sooner or later but the sound of bending sheetmetal still scared
 us a bit.<br>

It was nothing spectacular (sorry  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite10" alt=":oops:" title="Oops!    :oops:" data-shortname=":oops:">
 ) but nevertheless, we were in a situation were our wheels were 20 cm 
off the ground. We do not have locking differentials by the way.<br>
<br>
We got our shovel out again  :roll: and starting to add ground 
underneath our wheels to make them grip again and made the next few 
meters a bit more level hoping that we would righten ourselves again. It
 worked like a charm but it was a great amount of work. Damage was 
limited to a few extra dents.<br>
<br>
Still exhausted we continued, still in bizarre angles.<br>
<br>
Then we tipped over again..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">"Annoyed" 
would be a correct word to describe our mood. We could still see were we
 tipped over last time and we knew how much digging it takes to get the 
car righted again.<br>
<br>
No choice... out came the shovel... and eventually we got out again... 
and it did not take another kilometer before we... tipped over again... 
and again..<br>
<br>
And again.<br>
<br>
At this rate it would take years to get us to Ilebo, we had to find a 
way to keep moving. Now, most of the road was ok to drive on. The little
 indicator on our dashoard learned us that we could keep driving until 
about 35 degrees tilt angle. It were only occasional patches were the 
angle would become too big and we'de be on our sides.<br>
<br>
We figured that if we would keep enough momentum, that we would slide 
forward on our side and "bounce back" on our wheels. So, that is what we
 did. We kept the speed up and if the road dipped too much we would tip 
over. Because of the higher speed the impact on the side was much 
bigger. But that, combined with the forward movement created a "jo-jo" 
effect (do you guys know what a jo-jo is? Not sure if it is called the 
same in English).<br>
<br>
Move forward. Tip over. Slide forward a bit on the side of the car. 
Bounce back. Wheels touch the ground. Move forward. And repeat.<br>
<br>
Some of the longer steep section were maybe 100meter long. We would 
"bounce" numerous times to get trough this. When we got trough we had a 
fixed procedure:<br>
<br>
- Depending on what side we tipped over, the person sitting on the opposite side would get out of the car first.<br>
- Armed with a hamer and spanner "20" go to the other side of the car<br>
- Bang and bend the door back into shape so it would open again<br>
- Both of us would walk back the part we just "bounced" trough, picking 
up all the parts of the car that fell of. Usually the mirrors, various 
bits and pieces of the filling cap, the sandladders, indicator lights 
and the odd bits of our roofrack.<br>

Strong car!<br>

This technique is probably not described in any "4x4 driving techniques" handbook.  :wink:</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">That
 day we did the "tip over thing" at least 20 times. After a while you 
stop worrying about the dents, but I can still hear the sound of the 
impacts.<br>

Then, out of the blue, there was a road! This was completely absurd, as 
this road led to nowhere, but here it was, a recently build road about 
10 meters wide. The forest was cut and cleared, the ground was made 
level and smooth as silk  8O <br>

<br>
Where did this come from?<br>
<br>
We drove onto the road and immediately started sinking in. I floored it 
to keep momentum and we crept forward, leaving deep ruts behind us.<br>
<br>
We felt really bad when that happened. Somebody put a huge amount of 
effort in building a road here. And then comes along this stupid tourist
 and he just pulls two big ruts spot in the middle of this road.<br>
<br>
We did not stay around to take a picture of our ruts, we were a bit embarrased.<br>
<br>
The road dissapeared as suddenyl as it appeared before.<br>

</blockquote>If we stayed at a campsite and had running water, we did 
the wash there. When you travel for a long time, you regularly stay 
somewhere for a few days to get organized again. Sometimes we were "on 
the go" for a longer period of time, then we washed up in rivers or 
whatever was available. We did this immediately after stopping at night.
 If it wasn't dry in the morning, we hung some bungees in the back of 
the car. We probably had a permanent grubby look though.<br>
In DRC it was a lost case. The humidity, the mud, the digging. We looked
 -and smelled - like we got stuck in the jungle for two months! ;-)<br>

useable. In Japan we bought the same stove again. Seconhand. That one 
was shot after 6 months of dirty Russian fuel. We then ordered a Primus 
Omnifuel and had it shipped to Cairo. A bit more work to set up, and 
only one pit. But it worked. After 6 months we had to rebuild the entire
 stove, but it is still functional now.<br>

</blockquote>When we were busy digging we thought of only one thing: 
getting out of the obstacle, using whatever was available. Thinking 
about the things that we did not have but could have helped us at the 
time would have been a sure recipe to get a depression.<br>
<br>
But yes, it did cross our mind. And yes, it would have helped 
tremendously and reduced the damage the our car (the value of all the 
things we broke exceeds - by far - the price of a winch). But did we 
need it? Nope, we have always gotten out this far without a winch<br>
<br>
But given the option, I would choose the month extra any time.<br>
<br>
That said, I am building a new and improved version and a winch is on my shopping list.. but only if we have some spare cash..<br>
<br>
Then again, there is something magical about getting trough impossible 
obstacles. The improvisation, the stress, the hard labour.. Great stuff!

The road was pretty varied. Jungle track. 'Bouncing track', weird 
patches of newly constructed road, etc.. I am not sure which kind of 
road we liked more... or disliked more.. . Often we had to wait to let 
the bicycles pass, sometimes they had to wait to let us pass.<br>
<br>
Not surprisingly we would not make it to Pembeyangu today either. They 
gave us too much hope in Kananga that we could make it in one day. It 
was obvious that nobody there had recently travelled on this stretch. Or
 maybe they had travelled it on foot or on a bicycle, and they do not 
have a clue how difficult this road is with 4 wheels instead of 2.<br>

We stopped in the biggest 'town' in the area, Domiongo. It took a bit of
 searching to find a cathalic mission, it was on the outskirts of the 
villlage. Once again we were greeted friendly and had permission to camp
 in their grounds. We sat together with the fathers and talked for many 
hours. <br>
<br>
They told us about the mysterious roads. Apparently some NGO (they did 
not know the details... or they told the details and we forgot) has 
funded the construction. Several teams started working at several 
locations. The different bits were supposed to connect at one point. As 
of recent, work had nearly stopped... no more budget. It was unclear if 
more budget would become available or not. In any case the idea of the 
construction was to invest all the money in labour instead of buying an 
expensive CAT. Great idea ofcourse, that way all the money stayed in 
DRC, instead of filling the pocket of some bigwig at CAT. If you look at
 the road it was quite a feat. They thought about drainage and 
everything. Unfortunately they could not compress the earth enough with 
the tools they had. We already started a few ruts, it would only take 1 
heavy truck to completely destroy these roads again. These roads would 
not last a rainy season.<br>
<br>
The major complaint of the fathers was the upcome of all sorts of other 
religious movements (we talked about 7th day adventists before, but 
other movements were active in the area too). They claimed that they 
grew in popularity because of the animated ceremonies. But these 
movements did not have the social network and organisation behind them 
as the catholic missions. People would no longer work at the farm of the
 mission, would drop out of school, etc... Apparantly 'alternative' 
religions were also gaining in poularity, like fetishism, ..<br>
<br>
Anyway, we talked about many other things too, it was a pleasant evening with interesting people.<br>

In the evening the fathers would run their generator for a few hours. It
 was in a little hut very close to our tent. The hut was half submersed 
from the rain water.  All of a sudden the generator shorted. Smoke and 
blue lightning came out of the hut. One of the fathers ran in the hut, 
barefoot (!), with a stick and hit the offending cable until it got 
disconnected. Brave father!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 15. Domiongo.<br>

motorcycle. You'd see them from time to time, it is the most luxurious

All over the world there is an unwritten rule that in remote or 
difficult to travel areas people help eachother. That is why in the 
sahara everybody says hi to eachother. That is why in the Mongolian 
steppe people drive for kilometers just to check up on you. People help 
when needed as they know they will be helped when they are in need. We 
very much honour this unwritten rule and will always assist when we can.<br>
<br>
So when this guy asks for oil, I do not hesitate and take out a my spare
 can of oil. I warn him that this is oil for diesel engines, but that 
does not matter to him. It is probably the best oil he would ever find 
to put in his little bike. As I am pouring oil from my can in his can 
the passenger of the bike starts begging with Josephine. I am not 
impressed when Josephine tells me. And when the bike owner too start to 
ask for money, it really pisses me off. We are helping this guy and 
still he begs for more? So I pour the oil out of his can back into mine 
and tell them to sod off. In our car and off we go.<br>

For almost a month now we were in a serious fight with Congo. We were 
fighting against corruption. We were fighting against the roads. A 
constant battle. Congo was giving us a serious beating, but we stood 
strong and did not give in. Slowly but steadily we were winning this 
battle against the Congo.<br>
But while we were so busy battling the roads and the corruption, Congo 
sneaked in from behind. It had transformed us into loud and angry 
people. With no remorse, no compassion, and a total lack of rules.<br>

Upon our arrival in the (small) village everybody went completely nuts. 
Children cheered and ran after us, we had our usual crowd again. As they
 guided us trough the village towards the mission it showed that people 
here do not have notions about cars. They led us between huts, trough 
gardens, ... This was the way they always took to walk to the mission, 
but they failed to see that this was impossible with a car. As we did 
not want drive over peoples houses we backtracked and had to find 
ourselves another route to the mission. In the meantime the children had
 great fun climbing on our wheelcarriers. The wheelcarriers are not made
 for this kind of weight and one of them broke off... great! This was so
 much fun that the now targetted the other wheelcarrier. Josephine had 
to walk behind the car to keep the kids off.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately the father of this mission was not there, but his 
apprentice was. A very young guy, fresh out of school. He was not happy 
to be here, that much was clear. He did nothing else but complain and he
 would whine on endlessly. He was not a bad guy, but was wan't very good
 company either.. oh well.<br>
<br>
The mission had a small toilet hut. A hole in the ground affair with a 
roof on top, the roof was very low, which made it difficult to 'do your 
thing'. When Josephine made use of the facilities she could hear 
something rustling in the roof. When she look up she was face-to-face 
with a thin green/brown snake. I had never seen Josephine run so fast! 
From her description it could have been a green mamba? When told to the 
'maman' who took care of the mission she too was scared and with great 
care she chased the snake a way. "Très dangereux" apparantely.<br>

parked in the middle of the track. Luckily the surrounding area was 
pretty open, so we could pass it.<br>

Us: "Bonjour, ca va?" - "Hi, how are you?"<br>
- Them: "Ca va un peu bien " - "I am doing a little bit ok" -&gt; typical Congelese answer this!<br>
<br>
Us: "Votre vehicle est en panne?" - "Did you truck broke down?"<br>
- Them: "Oui, mais ils vient avec des nouveaux pièces" - "Yes, but they are coming with spare parts"<br>
<br>
So we chat a bit and we ask what their problem exactly was. They left 
Ilebo for Kananga with a load of building materials for a rich guy in 
Kananga. Their engine had completely seized. Their cargo was transferred
 onto another truck and they had taken the engine out and transported 
the engine to Kinshasa to get it rebuild. In the meantime the truck 
'crew' stayed onsite to safeguard the truck. But they were very happy as
 they just received news that the necessary parts for the engine were 
now ordered in Germany, so the parts would come arrive in Kinshasa in a 
few weeks time!<br>
<br>
A fascinating story, and they told it as if the was the most normal 
thing in the world. Fair enough. We said our goodbyes and asked them one
 more final question. How long had they been here?<br>

We were too exhausted to be happy that we could finally see Ilebo in the
 distance. We knew nothing about the city. We would have to arrange a 
ferry here to get across the Kasai river. Or worst case, arrange a barge
 to Kinshasa.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Hi uk4x4, if you don't 
mind, I am going to wait with my answer to that question until later in 
the report. You'll understand when we get there ;-)</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Our
 exhaust broke of just at the exhaust manifold. Probably due to to all 
the flexing on these roads. All hopes of arriving somewhere without 
getting noticed were out of the door with that.<br>
<br>
Quite to our surprise there was no checkpoint at the entrance of Ilebo. 
But actually that is not too strange, as nobody ever takes that road. 
Ilebo has a bustling harbour city feel about it. Lots of activity on the
 streets. We got a lot of stares, but people seemed friendly. <br>
<br>
We headed straight for the catholic mission and were greeted by Abbé 
Omer. The mission was the former headquarters of Belgian sisters 
(Josephites?). They had fled a the country a few times, and after the 
last war they did not return. The building was given to the Catholic 
mission. It looked like a nice building, but the decay had started.<br>

<br>
<br>
We discussed our plans with Abbé Omer in the garden of the mission (it 
must have been a wonderfull garden back in the days.. now it looked a 
bit rundown). The good news was that there was good ferry here that 
could take us across the mighty Kasai river. The bad news was that 
nobody every uses that ferry and it does not see any regular action.<br>
<br>
Omer knew the guy who was responsible for the Ferry, a chap called 
Barthélémy. He even has his phone number, but he does not have credit on
 his phone. No problem, he can use ours. A conversation in Lingala 
starts, it takes about ten minutes until we run out of credit on our 
phone. I actually think they talked 1 minute about the ferry and the 
other 9 minutes about other things, but anyway. Here was the deal:<br>
<br>
- Price for a two-way trip is 50$US<br>
But, <br>
- we have to supply our own diesel the engine of the boat. 150 liters is
 required (!). that's about 200$US (Diesel here is cheaper because they 
have a regular supply via boats from Kinshasa).<br>
- we have to supply two batteries to start the engines of the boat<br>
- the ferry is on the other side of the river and they would only be able to get it across somewhere next week<br>
<br>
That's just great!<br>
<br>
We immediatelly uttered to Omer that that was a ridiculously high price,
 one we would never pay. And that we wanted to cross as soon as 
possible. preferably tomorrow.<br>
<br>
What followed was a very difficult negotiation. Abbé Omer insisted that 
he acted as an intermediate person. According to him to protect us from 
getting ripped off (because we were white). I was actually convinced 
that he was playing a game with his mate Barthélémy to make some money 
out of us. It took us many hours on the phone to finally convince this 
Barthélémy to come to see us to discuss the price. He would come at 8 
the next morning.<br>
<br>
Later that evening Omer suggested that we he would have to inform the 
police of our presence (c'est normal!), it took us a lot of persuading 
for him not to 'give us in'. <br>
<br>
So there we were, staying in a courtyard of the mission.. with a gate 
that was so badly bend that it would no longer close. Hosted by an Abbé 
whom I did not trust (Josephine had a better feeling about him... she is
 usually right about those things). Waiting for a guy who wanted 250$US 
to ferry us across a river.<br>
<br>
Did you know that, by law, all state operated ferries in the Congo are free? Yeah right</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 17. Ilebo<br>

<br>
We got up at 7 - sleeping late! - so we would be ready to meet 
Barthélémy at 8. We felt so stupid, we should have known better. How 
lang had we been travelling trough Africa now?<br>
<br>
He showed up at 11:30.<br>
<br>
He had a bunch of official documents with him. Documents that actually 
looked legit. It described the running costs of the ferry (dated 
recently 2004 I think). And indeed, 75liters was stated as the amount of
 fuel required for a one-way trip. They would have to charge us a 
two-way trip as the boat was currently on the other side of the river, 
and they had to get it across first. Ofcourse there are no other 
passengers. There was not a lot of room for discussion there. The 50$US 
fee on the other hand was not legitimate at all, he knew it, we knew it.
 But as these guys rarely get paid by the goverment it is generally 
accepted that they ask for a fee. We got it down to a reasonable 
25$US(still too much). This would pay for the entire boat crew and they 
would 'rent' 2 batteries for us.<br>
We would buy a barrel of diesel (cheaper then per liter) and have it delivered to the port directly.<br>
<br>
We had a very long discussion about the payment, he wanted everything in
 advance as he had to pay for the diesel. We did not want to give a 
total stranger in Congo 225$US, without a contract (not that it would be
 worth anything), without having seen the boat, ... . He eventually 
agreed with a 100$US downpayment. We hoped we could trust this guy!<br>
<br>
He would cross the Kasai river tomorrow in a dug-out canoe with the boat
 crew to go and get the ferry. 'Somewhere in the afternoon' we would 
then be able to cross. <br>
<br>
I did not trust Abbé Omer. I did not trust this Barthélémy. I did not trust our deal. But we did not have a choice..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The
 mission had very nice rooms on the top floor. Every room used to belong
 to a sister. With a living area, a seperate bedroom and a private 
bathroom. With bathtub and everything. The bathtub looked a bit green 
and the toilet no longer had a seat (who is this guy who keeps stealing 
all the toilet seats in Africa?). We could use one of the rooms to wash 
ourselves, but we would camp in our tent.<br>
<br>
For a minute we thought they had running water, but they hadn't. There 
is a running water system in Ilebo, but there are no meters. Instead, 
people are charged depending on how large their building is. The usual 
corruption is probably included too. The mission had a staff of 3 but 
lived in a huge house, so apparantely their water bill was huge. They 
had thus cancelled the service. According to Omer almost nobody makes 
use of the water network any longer.<br>
<br>
Instead people operate 'commercial' taps on the street. You can go there
 with a jerry can, they fill it up and you pay per liter. In a way it is
 rewarding as you first have to work a sweat before one can take a 
shower.<br>
<br>
There was another guest in the mission. A father who was asked/sponsered
 by the UN to travel around and educate people about corruption and 
long-term planning. He held a talk in the small chapel in the mission, 
we sat just outside the chapel so we could overhear everything he said. 
It was very interesting. He talked about corruption, and how it would 
make it impossible for a society to have progress. He also covered the 
subject of the roads, he would encourage people to keep the roads in a 
good state in their villages instead of intentionally creating bogholes.
 He explained that in the short term they would loose 'income', but it 
would benefit them in the longer term if traffic increased (more and 
thus cheaper supplies, an actual functional economy).<br>
<br>
It was very refreshing to hear this and we really hoped his talk would 
make an impression. When his talk was finished we saw the people leaving
 the mission. 4 man had attended. <br>
<br>
That evening Omer had invited us to join them for dinner. We reluctantly
 accepted. Eating with 'the locals' is always in interesting experience,
 but very often it is just very bad food. As to not offend people and 
also as a precaution for us not to get sick, we tried to avoid these 
offerings in Congo as much a possible. We could see most people were 
happy when we declined as they have so little food already.<br>
<br>
We were pleasantly surprised, maniok leaves, something that resembled a 
stew and fufu (= pap for the South Africans, but made out of maniok).<br>

<br>
Our car was packed and ready to go... we were waiting for a phone call 
from Barthélémy. When it finally arrived around noon, Abbé Omer told us 
he had notified the police that we would be leaving from the port today.
 We have no idea why he did that, as he knew how much trouble we've had 
with the police thus far.<br>
<br>
Anyway, on his little motorbike he guided us towards the port. Not 
surprisingly we were stopped by the police who were waiting for us. As 
our boat was waiting for us, we were not in the mood for a lengthy 
negotiation. So as soon as they had checked all our papers (our self 
issued 'permit' was still doing wonders) we played bluff and immediately
 asked for their names and ranks and claimed we knew their superior 
officer. This was a risky move and probably a stupid risk to take at the
 time, but it worked. Somehow we sensed by now how confident the police 
was and we could play the game along quite well.<br>
<br>
We couldn't believe our eyes when we finally saw the ferry.<br>

Abbé Omer on the right.<br>

The trip across would take an hour as it was upstream. We felt very much
 at ease during that hour. We were disconnected from the shore, on a 
safe distance from everybody that wanted money from us, we did not have 
to drive. We just had to sit back and enjoy the ride. It was also one of
 the rare occasions were we got out of the dense forest and could have a
 look around.<br>

In Ilebo we had asked for the road conditions on the other side of the 
river. Nobody knew. People here travel by boat, not by road. We were 
silently hoping that the roads would be perfect on the other side. We 
couldn't have been more wrong...<br>
<br>
Barthélémy gave us a letter for his friend, the captain of the next 
ferry. It was written in Lingala, but we could make out a few words. The
 letter was about us but we did not know what it said. Would it be some 
good words for us? Or would it be some tips on how to extort the maximum
 amount of money out of us? We did not ask about the condition of the 
next ferry... It was probably better that we didn't know at the time..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Thanks
 for all the great feedback guys. Keep it coming! It's amazing to see 
how many people are following us on this little trip!<br>
<br>
Stay tuned.. we are not there yet ;-)</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The
 'jetty' on the opposite side of the Kasai river used to have a nice 
concrete ramp, but it had long disintegrated. To get of the boat we were
 litterally dropped on the muddy shore. Scary!<br>
<br>
There was a little village here, and our hopes for better roads vanished as soon we left the village.<br>

The road was no more then a tight single track. It is barely possible to
 pass trough here with a bicycle. After having verified that this is 
indeed the only track leading out of here we had no choice but to drive 
trough it. Half of the car was cuting trough the bushes. The amount of 
spiders and other critters that we took along for a ride was staggering.
 It was impossible to keep the windows open because of the debri that 
was coming in. It was also impossible to keep the windows closed because
 it was so hot.<br>

</blockquote>I can see your point... but... ;-)<br>
<br>
How many situations can one foresee? You could apply the same logic to 
almost anything. What about medical supplies? We carried quite an 
extensive kit, but if Josephine got bitten by that snake, what do we do?
 What about spare parts? What if the gearbox dies? (it did actually, in 
South Africa). In both case: seek help locally is the answer.<br>
<br>
What if your house collapses when you are sitting at your desk? ;-)<br>
<br>
That does not mean one should be reckless. And I dare say we are 
actually pretty prudent. It might not tell from this report, but we 
avoid unnecessary risks if at all possible. But that risk assessment is a
 personal thing ofcourse.<br>
<br>
Oh, and we do carry a hi-lift, we have used it extensively for our recoveries in Congo (sorry for not making that clear <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)">
 ). The hi-lift combined with the sand ladders and a bit of digging 
always did the trick. An additional bottle jack can do magic things too.
 We are also familiar with using a hi-lift as a pulling device. But that
 is such a horrible thing to do that we avoid it if at all possible.<br>
<br>
Oh, and we did crash trough a bridge once. We got out of that one with 
our hi-lift, sand ladders and a lot of patience and creativity.<br>
<br>
And then there is the danger of the human mind. We do not have a winch, 
so we drive with caution, making sure that werever we get ourselves 
stuck in, we can get out again. <br>
If I'd have a winch, I know I'd be much quicker in just risking it, 
knowing that I can winch myself out if it doesn't work. And then the 
winch stops working...<br>
The fewer of these tools you have, the more you are obliged to think about your next step. And that is not a bad thing! ;-)<br>
<br>
That said, a winch is on my shopping list, but it is not a priority.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The
 single track trough the forest went on forever. We had 'lost' a lot of 
time by taking the ferry and before we knew it got dark. We were still 
driving with one wheel on the track and the other in the forest. The 
darkness made it quite spooky. In the eroded bits the darkness made it 
very difficult to manouver our way trough. The mosquitoes were feasting 
on our blood.<br>
<br>
We passed a few villages in the forest, but they looked very primitive 
and wild. Not the most welcoming environment. We decided to push on 
until the village of Basongo, which looked big on our map.<br>
<br>
It wasn't.<br>
<br>
There was no mission here, they also did not have a priest, or a father,
 or .. . But they did have a "Maison de passage". A little hut where 
people who'd pass trough could sleep. We could camp next to this house.<br>
<br>
The crowd was huge and the kids went completely berzerk as soon as we 
stopped in the village. When driving to the maison de passage a dozen or
 so kids (and a few adults) jumped on our wheelcarrier at the back. 
Josephine had to walk behind the car to keep them off.<br>
<br>
This would be a zero-privacy night again. It didn't matter much as it was half past 10 already and we just wanted to sleep. <br>
<br>
With the crowd around, it seemed as if going for a pee before going to bed was the biggest challenge of the day.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress on day 19. Basongo<br>

We were on top of a hill, and we had to find ourselves a way trough the 
valley to the next hill. The deeper we descended into the valley, the 
worse the erosion got. Troughout the years about 10 parallel roads - a 
few kilometers apart - had been made down the hill. If the road got too 
bad, they just created a new tracks. The soil was sandy. We had to drive
 10 km's to find the latest track<br>

<br>
This short stretch was some of the more pleasant parts of the trip thus 
far. And open savannah where we could actually see something. Reasonable
 sandy tracks. We did get stuck a few times in the deeper ruts, but 
nothng dramatic.<br>
<br>
And most important: the people seemed to be more friendly this side of the Kasai river. We hadn't met any police yet either.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">With a bit of luck we'd be able to cross the Loange river today!<br>
<br>
The loange river was the second and last ferry we would have to take. 
Barthélémy in Ilebo said the ferry was functional, so that is good news 
as it was the last possible showstopper for us. On top of that, The 
Loange river is the border of the Kasai province and the Bandundu 
province. For us that was a major milestone, as Bandundu is the last 
province we would have to cross. Kinshasa is in Bandundu! It was still a
 very long way, but a milestone nonetheless.. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"><br>
<br>
With a bit of luck...<br>
<br>
Could it be that luck just doesn't work in Congo? The people here never 
really had any luck with the people that ruled them. They didn't have 
much luck with the foreign relations. Some of the worlds biggest and 
most dangerous diseases (HIV, Ebola, ..) originated here... that's not 
really what I'd call luck either. You could say that they are lucky to 
have all those diamonds, gold and whatnot burried under their very 
fertile ground... But that is exactly the reason that the country has 
been in a constant state of war for the last decades. Tough luck!<br>
<br>
We would not make it to the ferry today.<br>
<br>
Where the road descended down to the river, the Savannah abruptly 
stopped and turned into dense forest. The water had eroded a deep and 
very rough track here, we were very happy to have to do this downhill so
 gravity could help us down. At the last village people had warned us 
not to start the descent as a truck was coming up in the other 
direction. It is ofcourse impossible to pass eachother there.<br>
<br>
So we stopped on top of the hill and walked down. Sure enough, a big 4x4
 truck was stuck in the tracks. They were carrying a GSM tower that was 
to be constructed on the savannah behind us. They had hired a team of 
about 20 man to assist the truck on this stretch. Armed with shovels and
 pickaxes they more-or-less levelled the road. We watched them for an 
hour and they had moved about 10 meter in that time. It was another 
kilometer to the top. This would take some time!<br>
<br>
So we walked back to our car and waited... It was 10 in the morning.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">It got dark around 6 in the evening. We were still at exactly the same place. The truck had moved up a bit, but not much.<br>
<br>
We decided that we would go back to the last village and spend the night
 there. We asked the 'Chef du village' and he directed us to Germain, 
the principal of the school. We could camp next to the house of Germain,
 on the school grounds.<br>
<br>
Germain, the principal, was a great guy. Very friendly and concerned 
about everybody. He involved his wife in all the conversations, and she 
too was very friendly to us. Two of their sons were at university, one 
in Kinsasa, the other in Lubumbashi. He was not complaining, but he 
longed back to the olden (colonial) days when roads were functional. 
Apparently until 30 years ago there was a lot of wildlife here. Girafes,
 elephants and lions. His kids had never seen any of these though. All 
of the wildlife had been poached during the different wars.<br>

trough the night to get the truck up.. So maybe we'd be able to move 
again tomorrow?<br>
<br>
With a bit of luck...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 22</b><br>
<br>
At 4 that night we were awoken by the sound of a truck engine nearby. 
Finally, the truck had gotten up the hill (it took them 4 days). It was 
still pitch dark, so we tried to sleep a few more hours. But the 
anticipation kept us awake. <br>
<br>
We said our goodbyes to Germain and had a quick talk to the truck 
driver. He was not amused. He started from Kikwit two weeks ago. He said
 if he'd knew about the state of the roads, that he would have never 
taken this job. The GSM operator is paying him well for the transport, 
but he has to pay the local 'helpers' to get him trough here, he will 
have to be lucky to make a profit out of this ride..<br>
<br>
We plummeted down the hill and were grateful that the truck has just 
passed. They had broadened the road and levelled out the deepest ruts. 
We still had a struggle as the trucks massive wheels and ground 
clearance were no match for our little Landcruiser.<br>
<br>
Three hours and 5 kilometers later we arrived at the ferry... <br>
<br>
Oh boy...<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">There was a police officer at 
the ferry, and one or two onlookers. But apart from that it was 
surprisingly quiet. The police officer ordered one of the onlookers to 
go and get the captain. We sat down and waited in police guy's little 
hut. He was nervous and young. We joked around a bit with the people who
 were asking for money and cadeaux. Annoying, but not as pushy and 
aggresive as we were used to by now.<br>
<br>
The policy guy then told us we had to register. We did not feel much 
like it, but hey, if he wants to copy over all of our details in his 
little book, why not. When he was done he asked for money as he had 
registered us. We politely told him that registration is not a paying 
service in Congo. It never had been. <br>
<br>
That's not true he said, it is an integral part of his job to ask for 
money from people who pass trough here. We had a chuckle but stayed 
polite and told him that if that is the case, then why is it not in 
writing anywhere.<br>
He then caught us by surprise by claiming it is written in the official 
police handbook! He got up, and got out this little black book. It was 
titled something along the line of "Official guidelines for Police 
officers in the RDC" (not sure about exact title).<br>
<br>
The first chapter were the 'ten commandments' of the police officers, the third item read:<br>
<br>
"Créer une base de données de tous les voyageurs dans votre regio"<br>
<br>
He read it for us and said:<br>
<br>
"Créer une base de donnes de tous les voyageurs dans votre regio"<br>
"Create a base of donations from all travellers in your region"<br>
<br>
We couldn't believe what we heard. Had they really constitutionalized 
corruption? If this was true we would have little choice but to pay.<br>
In disbelief we took the book out of his hands and read the phrase again. Yes, it was really written here...<br>
<br>
It took us a minute before we realised that it was not "donne" 
(pronounced "don", like in Don Quichote) but "donnée" (pronounced 
don-E).<br>
 What was actually written was:<br>
<br>
"Create a database of all travellers in your region"<br>
<br>
We had to try very hard to keep our laughter down. At first we tought he
 just tricked us into it. But that was not the case, he genuinely 
believed it was written that he had to collect money from travellers. He
 had no idea what a database was.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">An 
hour later the captain of the ferry arrived. Barthélémy in Ilebo had 
given us a letter for the captain, but as we could not read the letter, 
we did not trust it. We decided to bargain first, and then give the 
letter.<br>
<br>
The captain said he could bring us across for 75$US and 30 liters of diesel. <br>%20
And we had to supply two batteries to get the engine started. <br>
And some oil because the engine was low on oil. <br>
And if possible a diesel filter because his was clogged<br>
<br>
Hmm...<br>
<br>
The diesel we agreed on, 30 liters is a bargain compared to the 
150liters from the last ferry. The price we ridculized and said it was 
waaaay too much. We discussed for half an hour or so, he was friendly 
but stuck to his price. Eventually we 'remembered' the letter. He looked
 happy with what he was reading. Eventually the price got down to 35$US.
 That is still an inflated price, but we agreed. Don't forget that the 
average annual income per capita in 2009 in DRC was estimated at 171$US.
 That's 15$US/month! <br>
<br>
Driving onto the ferry required 4x4 and we banged our gearbox (bashplate
 protected) hard while doing so. We almost cried when we saw the engine 
of this ferry. The 'machine room' was under water. Not really under 
water, it was a mucky oily substance. The engine was leaking badly.<br>
<br>
This ferry had been used to traverse Kabila's army when they marched in 
from the Rwanda border to Kinshasa a few years earlier. The captain told
 us how he was forced to work non-stop for 3 days to get everybody and 
everything across. Every little piece that Kabila's army could use they 
had taken. They left little more then a wreck. <br>
<br>
We had sent out somebody to buy diesel for us, he had to go two villages
 down the road to find some (on his bicycle). In the meantime we tried 
to jumpstart the boat. Our jumpleads were too short to get to it, so we 
took our batteries out (our Landcruiser is 24volt - 2 batteries).<br>
<br>
With our batteries connected the starter motor started turning. Turn 
after turn after turn after turn. Fast at first, but then slower and 
slower. Everybody was dead silent, hoping the engine would start.<br>
<br>
It wouldn't.<br>
<br>
They got to work, and took injectors out and doublechecked various 
parts. Another attempt was made The battery was getting really low and 
just when we thought it was not going to work the big diesel engine 
sprung to life. Hesitant at first, but after a minute or so most of its 
10 cylinders were working. No mufflers ofcourse, this was a LOUD engine!<br>
<br>
The captain's smile was priceless, he was proud of his machine! He gave 
it some trotthle and then the engine sputtered and died. He came down 
and said they had forgotten to purge the fuel system. Air in the system 
and the engine had died. Our batteries were flat now, not enough juice 
left to turn that big starter motor. We tried to start our own engine, 
but even that did not work. Bugger!<br>
<br>
But, no problem, apparantly they had 2 batteries in the village on the 
other side of the river. We could 'rent' them for a small fee. Having no
 other choice we agreed. With a dugout canoe some guys got across in 
search for the batteries. <br>
<br>
An hour later the captain had purged the fuel lines and we had two 'new'
 batteries. They were worthless. They measured 10 volt at most, they 
were not charged! Another solution came up: somebody in the village had a
 solar panel, and we could rent it. They thought it would take 2, maybe 3
 days to get it charged fully.<br>
<br>
Rather not..</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1587032679" data-lb-id="_xfUid-1-1587032679">

<br>
<br>
Sitwrap:<br>
<br>
-Our car was sitting on ferry - a ferry we hoped would not sink now<br>
-The ferry was not running<br>
-The ferry did not have batteries<br>
-By attempting to start the ferry, our batteries were now flat<br>
-Our car was not running<br>
-We could not push our car off the ferry as the ramps were damaged.<br>
<br>
If we wanted to charge our batteries, we needed a running engine and a functional alternator.<br>
<br>
We had to push start our Landcruiser, and we had to do it on the few meters of space we had on the ferry.<br>
<br>
Now seems like an appropriate time to talk about our brakes. As we had 
been doing extreme 4x4 work the last 3 weeks in mostly sandy and muddy 
areas, it does not come to a surprise that our brakes took a bit of a 
beating. As a matter of fact, we barely had any functional brakes when 
we left Kananga. And we have no brakes whatsoever since we left Ilebo. 
It's just metal to metal... and that does not brake very well. It hadn't
 bothered me too much until now, the big Landcruiser engine allows for 
great engine breaking and we are not driving any faster then 20km/h 
anyway.<br>
<br>
This made the situation a bit more complicated now..  :roll: <br>
<br>
As you can see on the first picture of this ferry, there is nothing at 
the end of the ferry to stop us from rolling into the fast flowing 
Loange river.<br>
<br>
5 meters. That was the distance we had. The ferry crowd would push us as
 fast as they could, I had to build up enough speed to make the engine 
turn, once started I had to engage reverse gear, let the clutch go - 
gently without stalling the engine or slipping the wheels - and come to a
 halt before rolling into the river. <br>
<br>
5 meters!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

I was a tad bit nervous when the countdown started. I closed the door 
but left the window open and did not wear my seatbelt. Just in case...<br>
<br>
3-2-1 and off we went. I dumped the clutch almost immediately. Way too 
early ofcourse and we came to halt. The engine was not running. On the 
second try I waited 'much' longer, but we did not have enough speed to 
turn the crank. I had about a meter of extra play.<br>
<br>
Third try was a good one. I dumped the clutch and immediately declutched
 again to throw it in reverse and with screeching tyres I reversed again
 just in time. I like a bit of tension, but this was pushing it a bit!<br>
<br>
The next hour we left the engine running with an increased idle to charge the batteries.<br>

<br>
While waiting we had a nice view over the river. At one point we could 
hear drums in the distance, approaching quickly. It was a 'cargo' canoe.
 4 or 5 huge dugout canoes tied together with a huge load on it and 
rowers on bot sides. Somebody was setting the pace with a drum. They 
were travelling downstream and were going really fast. That was one of 
the rare occasion where I saw the Congo I had dreamt about when I was a 
kid.<br>
<br>
We figured that after an hour of charing, the batteries should be loaded
 enough to start the boat engine. So we shut down the engine, took out 
the batteries and hooked it up to the ferry.<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">I take out the multimeter and it gives funny readings on our batteries. I am starting to fear that they are shot.  :? <br>
<br>
We have been on this ferry for over 4 hours now, and we have not really 
made any progress. Luckily we still have an ace up our sleeves. Our 
Landcruiser is a 24volt version. That means we have 2 batteries for the 
engine. (imagine you arrive here with only one battery?). But we also 
have two auxiliary batteries in the back, to run our fridge. There are a
 couple of reasons we had not used them up until now. Firstly these 
batteries are deep-cycle batteries, they are not made for cranking an 
engine, that could lead to damage. Secondly, to save space in the back I
 put the batteries in a location where they are very difficult to take 
out of. We would have to unload half of the car to get to it, It takes 
at least an hour to take them out. Not a fun thing to do in a car that 
has been standing all day in tropical heat. The idea of exposing all our
 belongings in this crowd is not really a good prospect either.<br>
<br>
But we had no choice now, so we started unloading our car on the ferry. Josephine on guard, me sweating inside.<br>
<br>
An hour later the ferry came to live again. It once again took a lot of 
turns of the startermotor before the engine would go.. these batteries 
too were now completely flat.<br>
<br>
I did not really see anything of our crossing (shame, it was a beautiful
 river) as I was trying to bolt the batteries back into the back of our 
truck.<br>
<br>
At 4 in the afternoon we reached the opposite side. With as much run-up 
as possible they pushed us of the ferry and I managed to get the 
Landcruiser started on my, rough, way down. We were greeted by a 
committee of officials. This was a province border (Kasai/Bandundu).</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 were invited in the customs hut. It had a little table and a wooden 
bench. And a big book. They registered us, asked for our permit (was ok 
for them), our insurance, etc.. When they were done they asked if we 
"had something for them"<br>
<br>
Time for the usual routine, this gets tiring after a while. So I 
silently count to 3, smile and with a very sweet voice reply that I give
 them my friendship and appreciation and give them a blessing from God..
 And that I am so delighted that such a professional and efficient 
custom service is provided (for free!) by the Congolese government to 
us, humble tourists.<br>
<br>
They ofcourse reply that they want something else. After which I put on a
 very sad face and ask why they do not want my friendship?<br>
<br>
This confuses them. That is the right time to get up, thank and greet 
them with a lot of words (not allowing them to talk back) and walk out 
of the door. <br>
But we were immediately redirected to another hut, the police hut. Same story there, same tricks. <br>
<br>
When we were finally ready to go, the first customs officer comes to me.
 He brings me my hat. I had forgotten it in his hut. These guys aren't 
bad, they do what they have always seen and done (ref. corruption).  We 
are glad we remained friendly with them. We felt very much out of place 
again.<br>
<br>
Slowly we drove off, back into the bush. Our mood changed when we 
realized that we had just left Kasai behind. That was the hardest part 
of our trip. Once we reach Kikwit, we know there is a frequently used 
road to Kinshasa. And from the people on the ferry we learned that there
 is good track - maintained by Belgians - from Dibaya-Lubwe to Kikwit. A
 quick check on the map learned us that we would reach that 'real' road 
soon. Not today, but probably tomorrow, depending on the state of the 
roads.<br>
<br>
The road was pretty bad and the going was slow. But it was not as bad as
 the roads from the last days. Most of the time we were still driving 
off-camber, driving in and out of huge pits, around or over obstacles. 
Slow, first gear movement. But we did not get stuck. It was pretty 
surreal that Josephine and I were having a very animated discussion 
while negotiating these serious obstacles.<br>
<br>
We looked back to everything we have been trough in the last 4 weeks. 
pretty crazy stuff! We have litterally gotten ourselves stuck hundreds 
of times, but we always managed to get us out. We laughed at all the 
nonsense we talked when trying to avoid bribes. We felt really happy 
now, relieved. A great sense of satisfaction came over us. We 
congratulated eachother for helping eachother out when the going got 
tough. We congratulated our Landcruiser for being so tough. <br>
<br>
Then a horrible, dreadful sound.<br>
<br>
*BANG* tak-tak-tak</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">I stopped 
immediately. I was pretty sure I knew what that sound meant. I turned my
 head towards Josephine and saw a confused, questioning look on her 
face. "What was that?" she asked. I did not say a word and got out of 
the car, looked at the wheels and saw nothing special.I walked to the 
other side of the car and saw this<br>

<br>
<br>
Everything seemed to pause for a minute. It was late afternoon and the 
worst heat had worn off, the sounds of the bush were omnipresent. We 
were alone. We were sweating.<br>
<br>
"Josephine, I think we have problem"</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">All 6 flange bolts had sheared off and the axle had worked its way out. Diff oil was seeping out (and dust in). <br>
<br>
This was not good.<br>
This was not good at all!<br>
<br>
We both sat down for a few minutes and stared at our rear axle. It was a
 sad sight. We are not superstitious at all, but maybe we shouldn't have
 been that positive? This was a scene out of a comic book. It is Donald 
Duck jumping on a bridge, shouting "look how strong this is". And in the
 next scene Donald Duck is seen falling in the water under the 
collapsing bridge.<br>
<br>
A guy on a bicycle stops and looks at the axle. He utters a long "ai ai 
ai ai ai ai" (think "The Gods must be crazy"). This makes us laugh and 
we repeat his "ai ai ai ai ai". He couldn't have expressed our feelings 
better.<br>
The bicycle guy says there is a village 500 meter further down the road.
 Tongue firmly in cheek I ask if there is a Toyota garage in that 
village. He gave me a crazy look. "Il n'y a pas de voiture ici!" - 
"There are no cars here!". <br>
<br>
We have got to do something, so I get out my limited toolbox and start 
removing the rear propshaft and try to close the diff a bit.<br>

<br>
<br>
With 4x4 engaged we still have a front wheel drive Landcruiser.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 manage to drive to the village, sun is low on the horizon by now so we 
wisely decide to stop here. We need to think about our situation. The 
usual 100 man crowd quickly forms. People here are still annoyingly 
curious, but they do not seem to be as angry as we experienced so much 
in the first part of our trip. Maybe we just get used to it more. Or 
know better how to deal with the situation.<br>
<br>
The chef du village assigns us a spot under a tree and we set up camp. 
Our morale is low, very low! It's been quite the day! First the hairy 
decent down to the Loange river, then the whole debacle to get the ferry
 across, and now with our broken rear axle. <br>
<br>
We are exhausted.<br>
We are dirty. <br>
We are running low on water<br>
<br>
We have barely enough water to cook some pasta, but not enough to 
freshen us up. When asked if they have some water for us, a guy called 
Patty responds cheerfully that their village is blessed as they have a 
fresh water source nearby. That sounds great, I ask if I can fill up one
 of our jerrycans. This is no problem, but he asks if it can wait until 
tomorrow. I push him a bit as we would really like to wash the mud from 
our faces and have enough to drink. He agrees to show me the source.<br>
<br>
So of we go, armed with an empty jerrycan I follow Patty. Out of the 
village. Down a hill. Into a forest. This is a steep track! And muddy! I
 wish I put on my hiking boots for this, I was slipping around on my 
worn crocs. After a 10 minute walk downhill I start questioning Patty 
about this source, I thought it was nearby?!? "Ce n'est pas loin, 
presque là!" - "It's not far, we are almost there".<br>
It is a very narrow track trough the bush. I walk trough spiderwebs a 
few time and mosquitoes are having a ball! Eventually we arrive at a 
murky source down in the valley. I am knackered! 30 minutes down. And 
now we have to go up again. With a full 20 liter jerrycan! I have to 
stop every 10 steps to catch my breath and eventually Patty asks me if 
he should carry the jerrycan. I swallow my pride and my politeness and 
quickly say "Yes! Please!". Patty is fit and strong and jogs up the 
hill. I have problems just keeping up with him.<br>
<br>
We have a nice talk on the way up. A monologue really as I am out of 
breath all the time. He was a nurse and used to work in the first aid 
post of the village. He had been working for free for years as there was
 no budget to pay him. But now they ran out of budget for supplies too. 
The first aid post in the village had been closed last year. If people 
got ill here, they had to travel to Dibaya-Lubwe for even the most basic
 of things.<br>
<br>
An hour and half after we left we returned to the car. I was broken. 
This 5km rough hike was too much for me know. I did not have the 
strength to do these kind of things. The women in the village do this 
twice a day!<br>
<br>
Despite all the worries, I slept well that night!<br>
<br>
Josephine on the other hand.. she did not sleep well. If at all! A 
combination of the poor food and the stress resulted in stumach 
problems... withthe side-effects that we are all familiar with. There 
was a toilet in the village. A hole in the ground with a hut on top of 
it. But it was all the way at the other end of the village. And as a 
bonus there was a huge hairy spider, right next to hole that refused to 
bodge. <br>
<br>
Poor Josephine!  <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite15" alt=":cry:" title="Crying    :cry:" data-shortname=":cry:"></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress afer our 22nd day on the road. 27th day since we entered DRC.<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Last night we had tried sending a
 few SMS messages to our favourite mechanic at home (Hi Pascal!  :wink: 
). The GSM reception was an on-and-off affair and after a few hours of 
trying we managed to get a reply with a few suggestions we could try. 
That would be the first job of the day!<br>
<br>
We had our spectators, but only 40 or 50, which is not all that much. 
Life in the village seemed to continue pretty much as normal. Women were
 grinding the manioc, kids were playing, men were talking in little 
groups.<br>
<br>
Upon closer inspection we saw that the bolts on the flange were broken 
off, leaving all 6 holes filled with the remains of the bolts. We had 
hoped that we could replace some of the bolts with bolts from the front 
axle (a tip from Pascal). But there was no way that was going to work. 
We could weld the axle in place, but there was no welder in this 
village. That would also destroy the axle and the hub, something I did 
not fancy. After all, if we arrive in Kinshasa, we are still 15.000km 
from home!<br>

<br>
<br>
The locals suggest we take our entire rear axle out and transport it (by
 bicycle) to Dibaya-lubwe. Fix it there and then transport it back and 
mount it again. That's how the Congolese would handle the situation. We 
had instant flash-backs to the truck that had been waiting for a year 
for its repaired engine. Rather not!<br>
<br>
We could not fix this here. We had to go to Dibaya-Lubwe, the closest 
city. It's not that far, so we decided we would try to get there with 
front wheel drive only. We would take it slowly and carefully!<br>
<br>
We tried sending an SMS home to let them know we broke down. But we had 
no reception at all. Most of the GSM towers here are generator powered 
and only run for a few hours a day (to hard/expensive to get supplies 
in.. and too few paying customers too I presume).<br>
<br>
Our engine did not start. The batteries had not survived the ferry 
ordeal. We had to get a push to get the engine started. We scared the 
people with our insanely loud exhaust (broken off). Children followed 
our badly beaten truck. We were a miserable sight.<br>
<br>
Even before we got back onto the track we got stuck. There was no 
obstacle. Just a bit of soft sand. We needed another push to get going 
again.<br>
<br>
The road is nearly perfect. Nice and flat, a bit sandy. Yet still, we 
get stuck on a 10cm incline. That is ridiculous! With all the weight on 
our rear axle it acts as an anchor. The front wheels on the other hand 
are not that much loaded and battle to grip. A little bit too much 
throttle and they spin.<br>

<br>
<br>
Out come the shovels again. For a 10cm hill! This is going to be a long, long day!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">This
 went on for hour, after hour, after hour. We would get stuck at the 
most stupid of places. The front axle alone just could not handle the 
weight and bulk of our Landcruiser on these soft sandy roads. We had 
deflated the front tyres and inflated the rear tyres. It helped... but 
not much.<br>
<br>
This was a particularely hot and humid day. We were feeling weak. 
Josephine hadn't slept all night. And my little hike from the last night
 took away a lot of what was left of my strength. I had skipped too many
 meals now, the adrenaline was barely enough to keep me going. To make 
matters worse we entered a forest again and the dreadful ruts 
reappeared. <br>
<br>
This went well for only a very short time. We came to this enormous rut.
 It was uphill so we had to keep our momentum or our front wheels would 
start spinning. <br>
<br>
Drive next to ruts, offcamber on the hill next to it?<br>
Or drive straight into the rut, which would be very bumpy?<br>
<br>
Normally I would have driven next to it. No big deal, it would be scary 
for a minute, but doable. Now with only one opertional axle I wasn't too
 sure. I  hesitated too long. At the last moment I chose to drive next 
to the rut but it was too late. We slid sideways and our rear wheel fell
 into the rut. Our car leaned heavily. Our chassis was grounded. Both 
left wheels were in the air, the rear right wheel was hanging in the 
void of the rut. We only had one wheel on the ground now. The back of 
the car was balancing on the reare axle. We were on the verge of tipping
 over. There would be no sidewall to keep us upright here. If we go 
down, we will end up on our roof.<br>
<br>
We get out and I got really angry! This is not the kind of obstacle were
 we would normally get stuck! I was angry at myself for not taking the 
safer route trough the rut. I was angry at Josephine for... I don't know
 why exactly. I was angry at everybody and everything! I was so 
frustrated!<br>
<br>
Josephine is a hero in these situations and she managed to calm me down.
 We had no other choice but to keep going. This would be one hell of an 
operation to get the car level again.<br>
<br>
We started digging to get some ground under the wheels and make a path to drive out of this.<br>
<br>
By now we were dirty. We hadn't had a decent wash in weeks. The dirt was
 everywhere. It was noon and the sun had no remorse with us. We were 
sweating like pigs. All the dirt that had accumulated on our body now 
turned into mud from our own sweat. With every movement the dirt would 
grind a layer from our skin.<br>
<br>
I stopped digging and got up. I was seeing stars in my eyes. I could 
feel the heat trough my hat. I looked at my muddy arms. I sank trough my
 legs onto my knees. I stayed like that for a few seconds. I wanted to 
get up. *poof* down I went on my back.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

</blockquote>Good question. I don't think we were pushing it too hard. We did have a few things in the back of our minds though. <br>
<br>
- We only had a two month visa that started on the day we applied for it
 in Lusaka, Zambia. That meant we had less then three weeks left on that
 visa. That is a long time, but considering the progress we had made 
thus far, it did not give us all that much play. DRC is not the kind of 
country were you want to run into visa issues.<br>
<br>
- We carried food for 30 days. This was our 22nd day so we were starting
 to run low on food. Most of the tasty stuff we had eaten by now. There 
was food around here. Foufou (manioc based dough balls) and if we payed 
to slaughter an animal, we would have meat too. But eating that food 
would increase the risk to get more stomach problems.<br>
<br>
- As you could have seen in the report, we regularly stayed in the same 
place for a day (even after the first day already) just for the reason 
you mention. But a day with 100 people around with no privacy at all 
does not allow for much relaxation. Staying out in the bush we did not 
do for security reasons. The 'gangs' would get us, no matter what. But 
the opportunist would be controlled by the social control in a village.<br>
<br>
- The more breaks you take, the longer 'the misery' takes. I prefer the short pain.<br>
<br>
- At this very moment in the report we made a succesion of mistakes. We 
did not take a break before starting to dig. We got into this mess 
because of a driving error. It just happened...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

</blockquote>Yes and no. When we decided to do the Congo trip we knew it
 wouldn't all be sunshine and happiness. That is part of the travel 
experience. <br>
<br>
It's a bit like people running marathons. Running 42km can be a painful experience, yet so many people do it for 'fun'.<br>
<br>
But I will be the first to admit that we had gotten a bit more then we had bargained for in Congo!<br>

</blockquote>The sun/ring gears in the rear axle are the 'weak' part in 
the driveline as far as my knowledge goes. You are quite right in your 
second statement there, that is why I have a winch on my shopping list 
now ;-) But I'll get back to that later in the report <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">I
 had hit a limit. This is exactly the kind of situation where I am at my
 best. Where I am able to keep my cool. Where I am able to remain 
optimistic. I have been able to keep my cool for over 3 weeks now. But I
 lost it here. <br>
<br>
I had a heatstroke too.<br>
<br>
This is where Josephine shines. This time she kept her cool. She put me 
in the shade and prepared me a dehyrdration drink (we have those instant
 solutions in our first aid kit). She found our very last piece of 
chocolate for me. She said the right words to me. Peptalk. Thanks to her
 I quickly came back to reality.<br>
<br>
I wasn't very optimistic though. If somebody popped up here and offered 
to buy our car I wouldn't have hesitated. If we had the possibility to 
take a helicopter and fly out of here, I would have taken the 
opportunity. Both cases were very unlikely to happen!<br>
<br>
While I recovered under a tree Josephine organised our recovery. She 
asked help from somebody that passed by. He wanted money ofcourse, we 
agreed to pay him.. but only afterwards. These guys are strong! It took 
him an hour of digging at an insane rate to make a more-or-less level 
path so we could drive the Landcruiser out of this situation. Driving us
 out of this one was one of the more hair-raising situations, we were 
playing with the laws of physics. The god of gravity had mercy and we 
made it out. This 4x4 work with a front wheel drive car is not easy!<br>
<br>
We paid our helper, we paid him much more then we should have. He was angry and demanded more. We drove off.<br>
<br>
We discussed our situation. Physically I was a wreck. Josephine was not 
feeling too fit either. We knew the 'road' was not that far from here, 
but we would not make it the way we were going now. We agreed we 
shouldn't get ourselves in a situation like the one we just had. <br>
Take it easy. If we need help, we must organize it. We accepted the fact that this was going to cost us money. So be it.<br>
<br>
The track went downhill from here. As soon as we hit the valley we could
 not get up a stupid little hill. The front wheels were spinning wildly.
 <br>
<br>
Right! <br>
<br>
We talked to the guys who were looking at our ridiculous attempts of 
climbing this ridiculous koppie. They gave us a friendly impression. We 
explained our situation, our broken diff, etc... We stressed the fact 
that we were not working for some corporation or NGO. We did not have 
the budgets these corporations have. We mentioned that we were willing 
to pay for help, but not much. It's not because we are mundeles that we 
would pay them insance amounts of money.<br>
<br>
Our reasoning was that if they started a discussion at this point in 
time already, that they would cause us a lot of trouble later on. But 
they agreed. They wanted to help us and work at a 'normal' rate. We 
'hired' three guys. Vita, Mufuta and 'papa' Bazil. They were overly 
optimistic and said we would reach Kapia that same evening!<br>
<br>
Kapia is the village where this track joins the 'Belgian' road.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">The
 main job of our 'crew' was to flatten the road as much as possible. And
 give us a push if we couldn't get over things. They would level the 
road, 50 meters at a time and then we would drive as far as we could, 
etc.. etc..<br>
<br>
This was actually working rather well! My depression from earlier that day was already forgotten! <br>
<br>
Imagine you are walking on the street, minding your own business. And 
some chap comes up and explains he has a problem. He asks you for help. 
You agree and travel with him to his destination. You have no idea who 
this guy is. You have no idea when you will go home again. You did not 
inform your family that you would probably not come home that night.<br>
That is how we recruited Mufuta, Basil and Vita.<br>
<br>
They were an energetic bunch and did their work with a lot of 
enthousiasm. Cheering and singing when we had gotten trough another 
'obstacle'. They were proud of their task too, and explained it to all 
the people we passed. We often had a few extra helping hands. <br>
<br>

<br>
After a few hours, the enthousiasm wore off from our crew. They too 
started to realize that this was very though and slow going. The road 
hadn't improved either. Especially Basil, who was already a bit older, 
was getting tired. By the time we reached a looong hill we were barely 
moving again. <br>
<br>
The group of people that was following us grew larger and larger. But 
they were not helping with the digging. They occasionally helped with 
the pushing. This was partly because of Mufuta, Basil and Vita had told 
them they alone were allowed to help. This to secure their fee. At 
least, that is what we guessed... they talked Lingala to eachother. We 
had also told them upfront that we would pay for 3 guys, not an entire 
village! We are not quite sure how, but after a while other people 
started helping. Did our 'crew' tell them they would share their fee? Or
 did they just help because they wanted to?<br>
<br>
I don't know... but we could really need the help. We were running in the last hours of daylight again. <br>

The later it got, the more people arrived. And the louder everybody got.
 Our 'crew' had by now grown to 20 something strong guys. they only had 3
 shovels, but they worked in teams. And as soon a piece of road was 
'ready' they all gathered behind our Landcruiser and pushed. They sang 
working songs to give the pace. People were clapping in their hands. 
Every 5 meter we progressed was a reason to celebrate. People cheered 
and dansed. <br>

I cannot help myself from moving rythmically behind my keyboard whilst 
typing this when I think about the ambiance. You could see people going 
completely wild of excitement everytime we kicked up mud with our 
spinning tyres while slowly creeping forward. I could feel the trusts at
 the back of the car from the pushing people. This hill was steep and 
the ruts were bad. Most people helping us now were from the next 
village. They had a vision, they wanted to get us in their village for 
the night!<br>
<br>
It was sometimes though, but they kept their - and our - spirits up.<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">When we reached the top of the 
hill everybody was going nuts. So were we! We couldn't believe we had 
actually gotten up here with a broken rear axle. That was some seriosuly
 difficult terrain!<br>
It was a now few hundred meters downhill and people climbed on our 
roofrack and hung on our doors for the ride. We were too enthousiastic 
to say anything about it now.<br>
<br>
We could stay next to Papa Likas's house. He was the guy who took the 
lead in the last climb. A somewhat older guy, and clearly one of the 
'richer' people in the village. He might have lacked the degrees and the
 education, but we could tell he was a clever and wise man. We were 
offered two chairs (funny how this form of politeness exists everywhere 
in congo). They were very funny affairs, huge thrones made out of heavy 
wood. We felt like the king and the queen. <br>
<br>
We were offered food - foufou and some fish - but we politely refused. 
It looked ok, but we did not want to risk getting ill now. We were too 
weak already (Josephine still had serious stomach problems). As usual we
 could see the people were actually happy that we did not eat, they 
didn't have too much.<br>
<br>
Our supply of water was low again. The 20 liters that had cost me so 
much energy yesterday was almost gone. Very, very carefully we inquired 
if they had a water supply. There was indeed a source, but "c'est très 
loin" - "it is very far". When he says it is far, I believe him! They 
bring us a small supply of rainwater to freshen us up. We will have to 
ration our remaing water.<br>
<br>
It struck me how difficult it is to get water here. People would have to
 walk hours and hours to reach a source. While at the same time the 
forest is so humid and sticky.<br>
<br>
I checked the GPS. We had moved no more then 5km today. I had reached my
 limit today. Although I felt ok now, I could feel that I did not have 
any more reserves. Josephine was the hero of the day, without a doubt. 
But she was suffering from her stomach problems. <br>
<br>
The village had become quiet again. Darkness had hidden the little huts 
in the forest. People could be seen, gathered around little fires. We 
saw a larger group of people gathered around hut. A strange kind of 
singing could be heard.. a very sad and mysterious sound. Papa Likas 
explained that a child was very ill and did not have long to live. 
People were praying. When asked what illness the child had, Papa Likas 
replied "On ne sait pas" - "We don't know". There are no doctors here.  
Another child from the same family died last month.<br>
<br>
We had a great evening with dancing and singing and all looked good and 
fine. And then Congo slaps us in the face again with its hard reality.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress
 after day 23 on the road. Day 28 since we entered DRC. I did not bother
 trying to add our progress on the map. The scale of the map does not 
allow for such small markings  :roll: <br>

</blockquote>No, it was a minor heatstroke combined with fatigue. I felt
 really bad for a few hours, but quickly recovered. Adrenaline is a good
 medicine ;-) Until then I had a seemingly neverending strength and 
endurance. I lost it then, I got tired very quickly from physical work 
from that moment on. But nothing permanent.<br>
<br>
Having it whilst riding a bike must be a very scary experience!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 24</b><br>
<br>
I really had to force myself out of our tent that morning, despite the 
noise off the village. My muscles hurt and my eyes preferred to stay 
closed.<br>
<br>
Mufuta, Vita and papa Basil had returned to their own village for the 
night, but they would come back. We sat down with papa Likas. He offered
 his help and we gave him the same explenation we gave earlier to the 
first members of our crew. He agreed with the conditions. He suggested 
we 'hire' 5 extra guys, including him, from his village. We knew we 
needed that kind of manpower to push 4 ton of Toyota trough the jungle. 
They would join us until we reach Kapia. Apparantely the road there is 
much better and we would be able to drive on our own to Dibaya-Lubwe 
from there.<br>
<br>
Papa likas made a drawing of how the road went all the way to Kapia. The
 first few kilometer would be slightly downhill until we reached a 
river. From there the road was uphill all the way to Kapia. The first 
part of the hill would be the hardest as this was in a forest with the 
usual ruts. Halfway to the top the road leaves the forest and we would 
be in much easier savannah.<br>
<br>
"Nous allons y arriver avant midi!" - "we will get there (Kapia) before noon"<br>
<br>
As soon as Mufuta, Basil and Vita arrived we were on the road again. Our
 batteries were now officially dead so we needed a push to get started. 
It was key not to turn of the engine now! Our crew loved the raw sound 
of our broken exhaust!<br>
<br>
We advanced quickly. Our crew was hanging on the sides of the car while 
two guys were walking in front, making quick improvements along the way.
 The way we progressed our first few hundred meters made mea actually 
believe we would make it to Kapie before noon! We must be the two most 
naive people in the world!<br>

It had been a while since we saw serious rain. Frequent showers yes, but
 not cloud bursts. Until now. Just when we arrived at the river in the 
bottom of the valley fat raindrops were falling from the sky. This 
usually means trouble. Our crew searched for cover in the forest while 
we sat in our car whilst a could emptied itself violently right on top 
of us. We could see the mostly dry road transform in a muddy stream. The
 hard compressed mud was gleaming.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">(This post is not part of the report)<br>

This rain couldn't have come in a worse time. The road was now extra 
slippery and we already struggled so much with grip - or the lack 
thereof. Our crew worked hard to construct a road that would provide us 
an as level as possible path with as much grip as possible. It took a 
huge amount of energy for every meter we worked ourselves forward.<br>
<br>
We could see our crew was losing its motivation and we feared that they 
would just give up or demand more money. It was Josephine that 
discovered the magic of our camera. These guys loved the camera! 
Everytime the camera came out they posed and they work like crazy to 
look cool on the pictures.<br>

I stalled the engine. I felt really bad about it as they could not 
pushstart us uphill. Only downhill. I let the Landcruiser roll backwards
 for a few meters and it still wouldn't start. The lost few meters would
 cost us hours to get up again. I did not want to go backwards any 
longer. So while our crew continued clearing the road,  I started to get
 our auxiliary batteries out again. <br>

Everything was just so hard now. Getting the engine started again had 
cost us an hour. The original enthousiasm was completely gone, we were 
moving forward at a rate of a meter per hour. The hill was about 
700meters long.<br>
<br>
We stopped progressing at all when we had to go trough a small detour around a tree. It was small but steep incline.<br>

With the rain also came the little moisture flies. Millions of them. 
tiny little flies. They favoured our eyes and ears and loved our nose. 
Annoying little thingies!<br>
<br>
We tried everything to make the road better in order toget us up this 
little hill. We had at least 10 attempts to climb it, but it just didn't
 work. <br>

Since we left the village early this morning we had covered 4 kilometer.
 Of which the first 3,8km were done in the first two hours. The rest of 
the day we spent on this hill. The last 3 hours we hadn't moved at all.<br>
<br>
Darkness was setting in again, we weren't going anywhere today..<br>
<br>
The crew wanted to return to their village for the night. We would be 
camping here. Just when our guys wanted to leave the news came that the 
sick child in the last village had died. A messenger was sent to the 
surrounding villages. This meant a lot of people would want to visit the
 family of the kid, so there will be a lot of traffic on the roads that 
night. A creepy thought to be camping spot in the middle of this 
situation, all alone on the Congolese jungle.<br>
<br>
Kapia became a mythic place for us. Our own Atlantis. The hidden city 
that nobody knew where it was. We started having our doubts if we would 
ever get our car out of this jungle again. Tomorrow is another day..<br>
<br>
We opened our tent in the place where we were stuck. All the batteries 
from our flashlights were empty (from last nights rythmic struggle) so 
we helped ourselves with a candle. The rainforest was insanely loud and 
peaceful at the same time. I would have loved this place otherwise, but 
it was hard to forget in what kind of trouble we were.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 24... Day 29 since we entered Congo.<br>

<br>
Our 30th day since we entered Congo. That needs to be celebrated! But 
not with any drinking. We are out of drinking water. It had rained a lot
 that night and our tent was still leaking.<br>
<br>
We had given an emtpy water jerrycan with papa Likas last night and he 
said he'd return with a full one today. But what we were mostly looking 
out for was that tirfor he was talking about. They knew, that a guy in 
their village used to have a tirfor, but they had not seen it in the 
last years. Likas would try to trace it down.<br>
<br>
We were delighted to see our crew again, not only with a full jerrycan 
of water, but also with a tirfor! But it didn't come for free..  :roll: 
The owner wanted 50$US to 'rent' the tirfor. This was an odd situation 
as we did not agree with that price, but the owners was not here to 
discuss it with him. We decided we would be wanting to spend 15$US - 
which is a lot of money! - and papa Likas thought that the owner would 
agree with that. <br>
<br>
I had already taken the auxiliary batteries out again early in the 
morning, so we could immediately start the engine and try to finally get
 out of this pit!<br>

The road was too steep to even attempt driving up with our front axle 
alone. We would use the tirfor for the remaining 500m. The length of the
 cable gave us about 10meter of progress with each go. Then the tirfor 
had to be released and a new tree had to be found to continue. 500 
meters. 10 meter at a time. Everybody knew this was going to be a big 
job. But once we would make it open we would be out of the forest and 
onto the savannah, were it would be possible to drive on our own steam

 guys were getting hungry. We could not blame them. They did not have 
food, and the nearest village was 5km behind us. Our food stock was low 
too, but we still had porridge. We bought a lot of porridge as it is 
very nutritious and takes little space in the car. I don't like porridge
 very much but we had eaten it every day since we were on the road.<br>
<br>
We cooked up a big pot for them. They loved it. To make it a bit tastier
 we gave them our pot of sugar, so they could add a bit to their 
porridge. We were still cleaning up our cooking gear and by the time we 
returned the sugar was all gone. They just ate a full kilogram of pure 
sugar! <br>
<br>
About halfway up the hill we ran out of trees. The trees had made way 
for thick bush. But nothing strong enough to hook up the tirfor...  
:scratch: <br>
Nothing is easy in Congo.. We cut down a tree.<br>
<br>
The procedure for the last 250meters changed a bit:<br>
<br>
Dig a deep hole in the middle of the road. Put the tree in the hole. 
Close the hole. Attach the tirfor and winch the Landcruiser 10meters 
forward. Dig out the tree. Close the hole. 10meters further, dig a deep 
hole in the middle of the road... And repeat.<br>

hadn't mae it up the hill and out of the forest, although we were close 
now.<br>
<br>
It got dark again.<br>
<br>
Nobody wanted to stop now, you could tell from everybody's face how 
tired they were. Papa Bazil started a song and the work continued. 
Everybody sang. No more joking, no more pausing. Just working at a 
steady pace to get this damn Landcruiser on top of the hill.<br>
<br>
Papa Likas told me it was his greatest wish to hop on to the back of our
 car when we made it to top and ride together with us to Kapia. There 
his task would end and would finally be able to go home to his family. 
We shared his wish!<br>
<br>
Late in the evening we made to the top, I still had the engine running since this morning. We were nervous.<br>
<br>
I put it in 1st and let the clutch go. We moved!<br>
<br>
*TAK*TAK*TAK*</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Everybody was shaking. Our helpers because of all the sugar they ate. We from anxiety.<br>
<br>
Who were we kidding anyway. We had heard the tak-tak sound before and we
 knew what it meant. I guess we were just hoping it would have been a 
dry birfield or something. Whishfull thinking.<br>
<br>
A quick run trough the the front driveline components showed the the 
noise came from inside the front differential. Trying to drive now only 
resulted in noise, no more movement. <br>
<br>
Our front diff had completely packed up. <br>
<br>
We switched the engine off and it became silent. Very silent. You could 
see the dissapointment on the faces of our crew. We had a deal with 
them, they would bring us to Kapia, no matter what, and we would pay 
them for the service. They were afraid now that they would not get paid 
(or paid less) as we would obviously not reach Kapia.<br>
<br>
We had to decide very quickly how and how much we would pay.  This is so
 difficult! We had no idea what a reasonable amount would be. We did not
 want to pay them too little. Because they deserved an honest wage and 
we certainly did not want to make enemies here. On the other hand we did
 not want to pay them to much as that would only open the doors for 
corruption and create the impression that 'white people' always pay too 
much.<br>
<br>
We decided on 150$US for all of them. 150$US divided by 8 = 19$US per 
person. For three very long had working days. Josephine asked me if I 
would be happy with that amount? I wouldn't. I'd feel insulted and angry
 probably. But in Congo that is a lot of money. This was so difficult!<br>
<br>
We gave the money to papa Likas and thanked them for all their work. We 
also gave them our axe, for which they were very grateful. We barely 
used it anyway. <br>
<br>
Our crew then dissapeared in the darkness, leaving us all alone on the savannah.<br>
<br>

Papa Bazil, Mufuta, Vita, Papa Likas, Masambe, Bony <br>
<br>
We knew we had a bit of problem here, but we did not discuss it too 
much. We were tired and hungry. There is nothing we could do now anyway 
so we opened up our tent and made ourselves a nice meal. We cooked some 
pasta, opened a can of tuna and used our last package of instant 
mushroom sauce. Whatever would happen tomorrow, we might as wel do it 
well fed.<br>
<br>
20 minutes after our crew had left we heard some very loud "YAHOO's" 
emerging from the forest. We recognized the voices. Probably they had 
waited with counting the money until now, and the result seemed to make 
them very happy. We paid too much..<br>
<br>
It was a beautiful night again, as we were in the savannah now we had a 
clear view of the sky. The African sky can be so magnificently 
beautiful. We only had a candle to provide us with some light. In 
different situations this would have been the perfect bushcamp.<br>
<br>
A strange sense of rest came over us, in a way we felt relieved. We were
 happy that we would no longer have to struggle with only a functional  
front axle.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 25 on the road. Our 30th day in DRC.<br>

<br>
We slept until the heat of the sun chased us out of our tent and cooked up a strong breakfast of my <i>favourite</i> porridge.<br>
<br>
It was time for a sitwrap:<br>
<br>
- Our car's bodywork was badly damaged<br>
- Exhaust broken off<br>
- Two broken batteries<br>
- Rear drivetrain broken<br>
- Front drivertrain broken<br>
- Our gearbox was no longer connected in to our wheels = not possible to jumpstart. Not possible to move.<br>
- Running low on food<br>
- Running very low on water, less then 2 liters.<br>
- Nobody knew where we were. The last time we were able to contact somebody was in Kananga. 2 weeks ago.<br>
- No cell phone reception.<br>
<br>
We hid all valuable things (camera, GPS, ..) in our car.<br>
We left a note inside our car with a description of our intentions.<br>
We blinded the windows as good as we could.<br>
We put on our hiking boots and a hat.<br>
We took our passports, our 2 mobile phones, some immodium and dafalgan and some sunscreen.<br>
We filled a bottle with our last remaining bit of water.<br>
We locked the doors of our car<br>
<br>
We walked out...</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">For the record: this is not over yet <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"><br>

We were on a 2 year trip, of which this Congo bit is just a very small 
part. We had sold everything we owned in order to be able to do this 
trip. The car and its content were (and you can take that very 
literally) the only things we owned. There was no house at home, no 
furniture, no clothes. As a matter of fact, there was no 'at home' other
 then our Landcruiser. And indeed, we had a carnet on this car. We were 
not just going to leave it there. <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"><br>
<br>
As for the dureability of the car: I will post my afterthoughts when the
 report is finished. Let's just not forget that we were already 
travelling 20 months non-stop. We had already completed 2 trans-africa's
 and a trans-asia. 95% offroad, some of it pretty extreme. A lot more 
gory technical details and insights will come in the next few 
installments.<br>

They were the first people we met since we started walking. 2 ladies 
with a kid on their back. It must have been the weirdest sight to see 
two wite people walking here, coming from apparantly nowhere. With no 
luggage, no transport, no nothing. And then these white people claim 
they all the way from Lubumbashi - They did not ask how we got here, so 
we were not lying! ;-) This must have confused them! I am sure they 
would understand when they saw a broken down car a few kilometers down 
the road.<br>
<br>
It was a 2 hour hike to Kapia. It had been a while since we made such fast progress. <br>
<br>
Kapia was just a small village on a crossroad, we actually walked passed
 it at first, it was that small. We talked to a few people. The bad news
 was that nobody here would be able to help us. The good news was that 
in Dibaya Lubwe, there was a mission. And the father there had a Toyota 
Landcruiser. The chef du village gave us the phone number from the 
father. In kapia there is barely any cell phone reception. On top of a 
little hill in the middle of the village is the only place where - 
sometimes - there is some repection.<br>

It took us a dozen of attempts to actually make a call (reception kept 
dropping) and get the father on the phone. It was a very bad connection.
 We could make out that his 4x4 was in Kinshasa to get it fixed. Then 
the connection dropped again.<br>
<br>
We figured that going to Dibaya-Lubwe was the only way to find help.<br>
30km would be a very long hike. There are a few bicycles in the village 
and we try to rent them. But they only want them rent them with a 
'driver'<br>
<br>
So we get chauffeured on the back of a bicycle. The luggage rack exists 
of nothing more then 2 iron bars. There are ofcourse no steps to put our
 feet on. I am not sure who suffered most, our drivers or we.<br>
It got tricky on a long downhill when my driver said that we were going 
too fast because of all the weight. I shouted to him that he should 
brake. He then replied that he did not have brakes! Nice! They brake 
with their bare feet on the ground.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

 biketaxi's dropped us off at the Catholic mission of Dibaya-Lubwe were 
we were greeted by the father (whose name we have forgotten). He did not
 seemed to be very interested in us. He had received the SMS message we 
sent from Kapia but he did not reply because he was not sure if we were 
travelling on a bike or in a car. Strange reasoning.<br>
<br>
His Landcruiser had its injectors replaced in Kinshasa at the time and 
he was about to leave to Kikwit himself for his annual 'holiday' by 
bushtaxi. He eventually hooked us up with some guys who own one of the 
few trucks in Dibaya-Lubwe. They wanted to drive to our car and tow us 
into the mission, but when asked about the price they were vague. "Pas 
beaucoup" - "Not much" they said. As they looked and acted very dodgy we
 insisted but this was a very difficult topic apparantely. The father 
eventually persuaded us that we should trust them. That would prove to 
be a mistake.<br>
<br>
30 minutes later they come to pick us up. We then spend the next hour 
picking up people and goods. There are not a lot trucks running here and
 they never leave empty. Many people grabbed the opportunity to 
transport them or their good as far as Kapia. But this was a paying 
service ofcourse and the way the drivers handled it was not pretty I 
must say.<br>
<br>
It was a rough ride and they ride these old truck hard. Very hard. It's 
hard work for the driver. The seat had long desintegrated and this 
gearbox required doubleclutching trough A LOT of gears. Cool truck 
though. I don't want to know how much this beast consumes. Actually I 
did want to know as we would be paying for the diesel!<br>
<br>
When we arrived back to our truck papa Likas was waiting for us. He had 
brought us water and a branch of a banana tree full of little banana's. 
He also wanted to talk to me about what we thought was best. Whiskey, 
brandy or cognac. This flabergasted me. I could not produce an answer to
 that question at that time. At least we knew what he was planning to do
 with the money he earned from us..<br>
<br>
Fortunately the truck too was 24volt, so they could jumpstart us with 
our leads. We would need a running engine to power the steering.<br>
<br>
Ever since we arrived in Kapia everything went very quickly. We had been
 lucky to find a vehicle that could tow us so smoothly. We just hoped we
 could trust these guys as they were very dodgy. The fact that they 
owned a truck was obviously a status symbol. They showed of their power 
and wealth too. Smoking a lot of cigarettes, flashing their new mobile 
phones.<br>

In this case we knew a larger city was not too far away, walking out was
 an easier/safer thing to do then starting to work on the truck locally.<br>
<br>
There is also a bit of long term thinking involved. If we had buggered 
up our hubs and half shafts by welding them, we would be in for a very 
costly repair and probably have difficulties sourcing these parts. If we
 reach Kinshasa, that is the end of the Congo episode, but not the end

We told the truck driver not to drive too fast on the way back. "Polé-polé" (swahili for slowly-slowly).<br>
<br>
He might not have been the most pleasant person, but he did know how to 
drive his truck. At a slow tempo he towed us all the way into 
Dibaya-Lubwe and dropped us off at the catholic mission. We used our 
kinetic strap for the tow, that reduces the jacking about when he takes 
off. It was a scary ride at moments. Driving a few meters behind a 
truck, with no brakes.<br>

<br>
It was close to midnight when arrived at the mission, but there was 
still a lot of action going on. We obviously drew a crowd. But at the 
same time the weekly bushtaxi to Kikwit was about the leave. It's a 
regular Toyota Landcruiser, like ours, who does this run - loaded to the
 brim. The only person we 'knew' here - the father of the mission - was 
about to leave with this taxi.<br>
<br>
Then the discussion about the money started. The drivers of the truck 
were still very vague about how much we owned them. They eventually told
 their price: 650$US !!<br>
<br>
At first I thought I misunderstood them, after all their French was not 
that good and mine is far from perfect too. But no, they really meant 
650$US. This made me angry, very angry. <br>
<br>
We had to make a split second decision here. If we hestiated too long, 
they would think we were considering the amount and talking the price 
down would become very difficult. If we pissed them off too much we were
 making ourselves very vulnerable. We very well knew we had nowhere to 
go and we would be needing the help of the people here to get us going 
again.<br>
<br>
0.1 seconds later I started shouting in a very African way. 
Gesticulating with my arms. Clearly indicated that their price was 
completely ridiculous (it was!) and we would never pay this.<br>
<br>
A heated discussion started. This drew an even bigger crowd.  It was 
pitch dark and we were in a city we did not know. Several hundred people
 were around us and some of them were getting quite upset. They saw an 
opportunity to earn a lot of cash. We could not give in to it now, it 
would make our situation impossible if we ever wanted to get our car 
repaired here. Josephine would later tell me that this was a very scary 
situation. I was too much in an adrenaline rush to even notice at the 
time.<br>
<br>
The father - clearly very annoyed as he wanted to leave - eventually 
came to negotiate before things got out of hand. We had calculated that 
the the truck used 50$US in fuel. We offered to pay 75$US, still way too
 much. The driver was very dissapointed, he probably had visions of what
 he'd be able to buy with 650$! It took the father an hour to talk the 
price down to 100$. We agreed.<br>
<br>
We saw the father off and thanked him for his help. He gave us 
permission to camp in the - unfenced - garden of the mission. There was a
 small workshop at the mission. The only one in town apparently. We 
could make use of that to get our car fixed.<br>
<br>
Still with a big crowd around us we set up our tent and tried to go to sleep.<br>
<br>
It was a miracle that we were able to get our car towed to the mission 
in one day. We were glad we could sleep in our own tent that night and 
that we did not had to leave our car in the jungle overnight. Getting 
our car going again would be another story. We might be stuck here for a
 while.<br>
<br>
We did not make any friends in Dibaya-Lubwe today.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after day 26 since Lubumbashi. 31st day in Congo. Visa expiring in less then 3 weeks. Dibaya-Lubwe<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 27</b><br>
<br>
We did not feel like getting out of our tent today. It was very unlikely
 that this would be a fun day. We had to arrange to get our car fixed 
here and I had no idea where to start. There was nobody we knew here 
that could help us.<br>
<br>
When we opened our tent the crowd was there already. Approximately 100 
man and children. They crawled in eachothers necks to get a better view 
inside our tent. That is not a pleasant way to start your day! Even 
before we are good and well out of our tent the truck driver we had a 
fight with last night approached us. He was shy now and friendly. He 
told us he was a very good mechanic and that he wanted us to hire him to
 fix our car. Sorry dude.. no way!<br>
<br>
With all the onlookers still there we talked to the driver of the father
 of the mission (temporarily out of work due to lack of car). He was a 
mechanic too (everybody is a mechanic here) and wanted to help us. To us
 that looked like the best bet. In a city where there are no cars it is 
very hard to find a mechanic that has some experience with Landcruisers.
 At least we were sure this guy had seen one of these from closeby. with
 our experiences from last night fresh in our memory we first discussed 
about the price. It is quite common to pay 'per job' for these kind of 
things. <br>
<br>
The idea is that we would try to get the rear axle fixed so we can drive
 to Kikwit, we would try to get the front axle fixed there or in 
Kinshasa. For this the mechanic asks 200$US. That is more then he would 
earn in a year. He explains that he would have to rent tools and it's 
not just for him, but for an entire team. Eventually we settle on 50$US 
for the labour. We are still grossly overpaying them, but we feel we 
have no choice. <br>
<br>
After the negotiation I plainly ask them if they had asked so much money
 just because we are white. They felt uncomfortable with the question 
but confirmed.<br>
<br>
I am not a mechanic. But neither were these guys. They had the skills to
 make everything work, but they did ugly things. They only knew two 
tools: a hamer and a screwdriver. And the screwdriver was mostly only 
used in combination with the hamer. The entire process I had to keep 
watching them to make sure they did not round any more bolts or hamer my
 axle to pieces. The moment I turned my back I could hear them banging 
away.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
Once the hub on the rear axle was removed, they had to remove the broken
 bolts. There is no electricity in Dibaya-Lubwe. The generator of the 
mission was broken. They did not have an electrical drill anyway. But 
they did have a manual hand operated drill. It must have been quite the 
tool 100 years ago, but nowadays nobody would even consider to use this 
to drill into metal. Needless to say the the drill bits were not of the 
best quality either. They would drill out the holes and tap new wire 
into them (1 size bigger). Our hub was buggered anyway so I let them do 
it. It took them an entire day of turning that drill!<br>

<br>
<br>
By the end of the day all bolts were cleared, new threads were tapped 
and fitting bolts (of horrible quality) were found. It had gotten too 
dark already to re-assemble everything. Tomorrow morning they would be 
able to fit them and by noon we would be ready to go again! Great!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 28</b><br>
<br>
I wish I could say that we got used to looking into 100 faces first 
thing in the morning. But I can't. It annoyed us immensely to have this 
crowd looking at us. From the minute we opened our tent in the morning 
until we close it again in the evening. They 'work' in shifts so they do
 not miss any action.<br>
<br>
We really looked forward to drive out of here again. It was just a few 
more hours of work to get everything assembled. The hub was fitted again
 and the oil on the diff changed (lucikily we had bought diff oil in 
Zambia!). At 11am sharp we asked our mechanics to give us a push and the
 engine promptly sprung to life. That is a good sign already!<br>
<br>
Carefully I drive backwards a bit. Ok!<br>
Forwards a bit. Ok!<br>
<br>
I tell the guys I am going for a quick test drive around the mission. We
 drive out of the gate (the mission had a gate, but no fence) and...<br>
<br>
*TAK*TAK*</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Josephine and I looked at eachother. We laughed. That would have been too easy, wouldn't it?<br>
<br>
The mechanics pushed us back into the mission. The fixed hub was still 
ok, but our little mishap had probably damaged something inside the 
differential as well. That is bad news as this meant we had to replace 
parts. A manual drill would not provide a fix here!<br>
<br>
So be it. The mechanics took out the differantial. The planetary gears 
(do you guys know what I talking about when I use those terms? not sure 
of the correct terms in English) were completely shot. The sun gears had
 some chipped teeth but could still be used (hopefully). <br>
<br>
We needed two new gears. They did not have two new gears in Dibaya-Lubwe.<br>
<br>
We called up the father of the mission, who was on holiday in Kikwit. In
 the mission in Kikwit they had a bigger workshop and had better access 
to supplies. I eventually talked to a mechanic in Kikwit. He promised me
 to call me back in an hour. Two hours later I called him back... he had
 forgotten. Another half hour later came the news: no such parts to be 
found in Kikwit, but they could be ordered from Kinshasa. It would take 2
 to 3 days to get them to Kikwit(by air). And then we had to foresee 
transport from Kikwit to Dibaya-lubwe. The cost of the transport alone 
would be immense and it would probably take in excess of a week. Plus, 
how do we get the money to Kinshasa? You cannot buy things on credit 
here!<br>
<br>
Time for plan B: we started inquiring if there wasn't another 
Landcruiser close by, from whom we could 'borrow' some parts. It 
appeared that a remote mission, some 40km from here had a Landcruiser 
that had engine problems. We might be able to source some parts from 
them. Unfortunately they could not be reached as they do not have cell 
phone reception there. <br>
<br>
It was our best bet so we made a plan. We would rent a little motorbike 
for our mechanics, they would ride to the remote mission and hopefully 
they would be allowed to dismantle the axle of that landcruiser to 
'borrow' the parts. If that would not be possible, they would ride on to
 Kikwit and try to find some secondhand parts there. In the best case 
they would be gone for 2 days. In the worst case it would take weeks.<br>
<br>
Between the time we knew which part we needed until the time we had 
finalized our plan with the motorbike was 4 hours Time flies when you 
are improvising.<br>
<br>
We had the great prospect of spending some leisurely days at the mission. Our crowd would be thrilled!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">That
 night we felt like we had deserved a beer. We found the beer in the 
other catholic mission, the one from the sisters. Upon entering their 
mission it was like entering another world. They had a nice vegetable 
garden and flowers. Their house was clean. The sisters did a lot of work
 here, mostly as nurses in their hospital and orphanage. They made some 
extra money by selling beer. They were the only place in town that had a
 regular supply and, most importantly, they had a fridge(on gas)! <br>
<br>
It was heaven to be there. The sisters were really nice and smart 
ladies. Good mannered with a healthy dose of humour and interest. It 
felt so good to be able to have a normal conversation for once. A 
conversation that did not leave us guilty as would normally be the case.
 A conversation the not lead to begging. A conversation where we did not
 have to think about every word we said.<br>
<br>
We crawled in our tent. A 100 people made sure that we would not feel too much at ease.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 29</b><br>
<br>
We did not have anything to do today but to keep out of trouble and wait
 for our mechanics. We slept until the sun transformed our tent into a 
sauna. Upon opening our tent we were greeted again by the looks and 
laughter of our crowd. The first thing we heard today was somebody 
shouting from a distance "Eh Mundele -Donnez-moi de l'argent!" -"Eh 
mundele - give me money". A very good morning to you too!<br>
<br>
We would move our chairs regularly around the car, trying to escape the 
onlookers. Minutes later the crowd would then move too so they could see
 us again. They always kept a distance of 20meters or so, but nobody 
talked to us. From time to time they would shout something (usually 
begging). We tried to be as uniteresting as possible...<br>
<br>
After a while I got really fed up. I took my chair and put it close to 
them. I sat down, facing them. I looked straight into their eyes. They 
looked straight back. I just sat still for half an hour, hoping they 
would get bored of looking at me. Or possibly even embarrased. But I 
lost. They did not loose interest. <br>
I tried talking to them, explaining that we would really appreciate if 
they stopped looking at us as we would like to get some rest. I avoided 
the word privacy as it an unknown concept here anyway. I only got blank 
stares in return. From the back of the crowd I could here somebody shout
 "Donnez-nous de l'argent!" -"Give us money". Shortly after followed by 
"Ce n'est pas vorte pays!" - "This is not your country"<br>
<br>
This made me so angry. He was right ofcourse, this was not my country. I
 was nothing more then a visitor. I had no other intentions but to 
explore their country and meet the people. But they did not want me 
here. They wanted my money, but not me.<br>
<br>
We did meet a few interesting people though. A teacher from the local 
school came to see us. It was a math teacher. He had heard that I am a 
computer engineer. He had a question for me. He had heard about Internet
 and how it was such an interesting tool. But what is Internet exactly? I
 asked if they had computer here. They did not. He knew there were 
computers and Internet in Kikwit, but that is several hundres of 
kilometers from here.<br>
<br>
He kept me busy for many hours. I tried my best explaining him all the 
different components and concepts. Everything from a modem to a webpage.
 I drawed him diagrams and everything. But I am a bad teacher I guess.. I
 could see he had difficulties understanding it all. How do you explain 
Internet to somebody who has never seen a computer? He took my notes and
 said he would teach his students about 'Internet'.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-1-1587032788" data-lb-id="_xfUid-1-1587032788">

<br>
<br>
We constantly had the company of Anton. People called him "Le fou" - 
"The village fool". He was no fool though. Apparantely he was a very 
intelligent guy who had studied. It could be told from his vocabulary. 
But he kept talking and talking and talking. Always in a very dramatic 
way, swinging with his stick and jumping around. He would sometimes drop
 dead on the floor and stay put for 10 minutes and then he would jump up
 shouting loud. The kids loved him and were scared of him at the same. 
Children would sometimes throw rocks at him.<br>
He was truly very annoying (and he had an incredibly smelly breath) but I
 took a liking to him anyway. At least he was honest. He dared to talk 
to us. We appreciated that. But he was still very annoying.<br>
<br>
We will never forget his words: "Les blanc, les noirs, les rouges, les 
jaunes, nous avons tous le même sang" - "The whites, the black, the red,
 the yellow, we all have the same blood"<br>

</blockquote>Hi Riaan &amp; Stephanie! Good to hear from you again. I 
still remember when you asked me about the feasability of the 
Lubumbashi-Kinshasa track when you had problems getting your Angola 
visa. I didn't really know how to put my answer at the time, but I am 
sure you understand why I wasn't really recommending it ;-)<br>
<br>
Are you driving back down?<br>
<br>
Always welcome in Aalst for a beer!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Thanks
 everybody for the comments, we really appreciate all of them! Sorry if 
we do not reply to each and every message. I do my best to answer all 
your questions. Sometimes the answers are provided in one of the future 
installments.<br>
<br>
I am a bit slow with the updates but I am insanely busy with other 
things at the moment. I still spend every spare minute of my time 
writing this report <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"><br>
<br>
Cheers!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Another guy comes to visit us "Venez avec moi. Police!" - "Come with me. Police!"<br>
It's a guy wearing slippers and tatty clothes. We are not impressed and ask who he is?<br>
<br>
"Chef de la police de Dibaya-lubwe"<br>
<br>
We know where this is going to lead to so we tell him that everybody can
 claim they are police, does he have anything to prove his function? He 
hasn't. We tell him "au revoir" and ignore him. This annoys him 
tremendously. The look on the faces of the people around us tell us he 
was probably right and they can't believe we just turned our back to the
 chief of police! He leaves again. He was furious.<br>
<br>
We befriend Monsieur Shinandi. He is an older man in a lovely 
old-fashioned suit. He is the school prefect of the area. A very clever 
and friendly man. He actually apologizes for the attitude of the people 
towards us, he tells us he is embarassed about the situation. He also 
ask us to try to understand how hopeless life is for people here. That 
is the reason they act this way. We do understand, but we also explain 
that is not the same as accepting it. <br>
<br>
Mr. Shinandi accompanies Josephine to the town's market to make sure we 
get honest prices. It's nice to have some fresh food for a change. Eggs 
and tomatoes. Meat is available but it did not look very tasty so we 
skip it. Mr. Shinandi tells us a lot about the poor condition of the 
schooling system in Congo. There are almost no funds and the little 
funds there are dissapear before they reach their destination. Education
 is supposed to be free, but parents need to pay the teachers as the 
teachers are not being paid by the goverment. Most families can only 
afford to send a few of their children to school, not all of them.  He 
was genuinely worried about the future of his country. Without education
 the new generation is lost. These youngstes are the future rulers of 
Congo, and the only thing they learned is corruption.<br>
He also tells us about the abusive nature of many teachers, mostly in 
rural areas. Young girls are regularly forced to have sex with the 
teacher in return for good results. There are massive amount of child 
pregnancies. These children barely have enough to survive, let alone to 
raise children. Their parents send them to school with the hope of 
having chances on a better future, but instead their lives are ruined. 
They don't stand a chance.<br>
<br>
Mr.Shinandi also takes me to a bank to exchange some US$ into Congolese 
Franc. Most things can be bought with dollars, but eggs or bread and 
small consumables are paid in CF. In the bank they cannot help us... 
they have no <br>
money.  :roll: We eventually end up at the farmers organisation. They 
provide micro-loans to farmers. They wanted us to go trough a mountain 
of - self-produced - paperwork first but eventually give up and change 
the money. At a horrible rate for us. It is strange how people try to 
give the impression that everything is organized. They try to give that 
impression by using as much paperworks as possible. <br>
<br>
Walking around town with Mr. Shinandi is a pleasant and interesting 
experience. He is well respected here and because of that we are left 
alone. <br>
<br>
When we return to the mission a man in a police uniform is waiting for 
us. It's an impressive uniform with several stars on the shoulders.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">In
 front of us was the same guy that claimed he was "le chef de la 
police". He had dusted off his uniform. Looks like we made a little 
mistake there. We apologied for being so rude earlier and at the same 
time explained that we had so much problems with corrupt police before. 
He on his terms apologied for not being in uniform earlier and for his 
corrupt colleagues. This was actually a nice guy, he registered us and 
then chatted a bit. We probably shouldn't have been so rude earlier... 
but who knows how he would have acted then?<br>
<br>
Despite having had nothing to do today, we had a busy day. It was with 
great joy that we heard a little motorbike approaching. We had not 
expected our mechanics back so quickly. They had found us two gears! 
They looked worn, but at least they had teeth. They did not come cheap, 
but it was not like we had a choice here. It was too late to start 
fitting them now. Tomorrow...<br>
<br>
That evening we paid our daily visit to the mission of the sisters and 
went to bed early. We wondered when 'our wrowd' would get bored of us 
when they saw of us in our tent.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 30</b><br>
<br>
Our mechanics started working from early in the morning to get the diff 
mounted again. This gave me plenty of time to think about what went 
wrong. Why did we break down?<br>
<br>
The short answer is: we pushed it too much! But it is no surprise. It is
 more of a surprise on why this did not happen earlier. We had driven 
over 80.000km since we left Belgium. Trough Africa and Asia. Fully 
loaded (almost 4 tons) on some of the roughest roads in the world. We 
had quite a few things overhauled in Cairo and one thing I had noticed 
but did not change was a small chip out of the planetary gear. The same 
gear that was now completely stripped. <br>
<br>
The whole ordeal with tipping over and sliding on our sides was not 
really benificiary for our driveline either. We would be spinning our 
wheels fast and they would all of a sudden gain full traction again. 
Repeatedly. This kills drivelines. If we would have been able to drive 
slowly trough here, this would have made a major difference. Yes a winch
 and lockers could (!) have saved us a lot of damage. But that is an 
aftertought. It would be the only 2000km's on our 100.000km trip were 
they would have come in handy. There is not a single landcruiser who 
drives around the interior of Congo without a winch by the way. I'd say 
this is exceptional damage on an exceptional road.<br>
The front diff we just forced by trying to pull ourselves over the big 
hill. The brakes, batteries, bodywork... collateral damage.<br>
Would another vehicle have done a better job? Maybe... probably not I 
would think but I honestly do not know. But the Landcruiser 75 is 
certainly the right choice of car for travelling here. It is the only 
car the NGO's and missions use. It is the best bet for finding spare 
parts.<br>
<br>
We must have walked about 10 kilometers from where our car was stranded to the 'improved' road. So close! <br>
<br>
The seal of diffhouse was badly damaged and could not be used again. The
 only thing that could be found was silicone sealant for bathroom tiles.
 That would have to do... we hope!<br>
As soon as the diff is fitted again they wanted to pour the oil back in.
 This was the same new zambian oil we had already used, but now with 
hundres of little pieces of metal and a fair amount of dust. I did not 
want that in my axle! No problem according to our mechanics and they set
 out to buy oil in town. They came back with Monograde SAE-90 oil. In 
the fineprint it specifically said "not for use in motorized vehicles!".
 This was the best we could find and it was more expensive per liter 
then fully synthetic in Europe. We would use it and change it as soon as
 we found better oil.<br>
<br>
We did a test ride and it worked ok now. We still had no drive on the 
front axle, but the road from here was supposed to be good enough not to
 need it.<br>
<br>
Tomorrow we would try to get to Kikwit!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 31</b><br>
<br>
We looked at our crowd when we got out of our tent. We certainly 
wouldn't miss them! We paid our dues to the mechanics and the 
housekeeper of the mission and set out to find Mr Shindani to say 
goodbye.<br>
<br>
The mechanics, they didn't lie when they said it would a team. They 
might not have been real car mechanics, but combined they had all the 
knowledge required.<br>
<br>

<br>
Very carefully we started our journey on the maintained dirt track to 
Kikwit, 270kilometer from here. We could not remember when we last 
covered such a distance in a day!<br>
<br>
We passed trough Kapia, the village were had tried to make a phonecall. 
We stopped at the people we had met there earlier to thank them and give
 them an update on our situation. The sky was clear, so the phone 
reception was better now and everybody was making use of this to make 
their calls on the 'GSM hill'<br>

Belgian govermental aid. Like the 'mistery' roads we came across 
earlier, these roads are mostly handmade. The reasoning is to give as 
many people as possible an opportunity to have a job. But the CTB had 
been clever enough to use a few machines to compress the earth so the 
roads would not be destroyed instantly. At times it was still a bit 
rough, but compared to what have been trough it was truly heaven.<br>

We stopped from time to time to check our rear axles. It was already 
leaking pretty badly. That kitchen silicone sealant does not really 
work. Our hearts skipped a beat when we got our front axle stuck on a 
middelmannetjie. This meant we had to 'force' ourselves out of there. I 
really did not want to break down here again. Stressfull moments!<br>
<br>
We briefly stopped in Idiofa, a bustling town, to fill up on diesel. The
 fuel light had come on. The first time since we left Lubumbashi. The 
only diesel we found came out of a dirty bucket. We apologied to our 
Landcruiser and bought it anyway.<br>
<br>
And then we saw something that we hadn't seen in weeks.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><div class="lbContainer lbContainer--inline " title="" data-xf-init="lightbox" data-lb-single-image="1" data-lb-container-zoom="1" data-lb-trigger=".js-lbImage-_xfUid-8-1587032788" data-lb-id="_xfUid-8-1587032788">

<br>
<br>
I must admit I don't like asphalt. I enjoy driving on dirt roads. 
Josephine does not always agree with me regarding that matter. But this 
time I was properply pleased to see this. It would take the stress out 
of our rear axle. And it was good to know that our 4th and 5th gear were
 still there! ;-)<br>
<br>
The road is Chinese made. You can recognize the chinese from a distance 
by the big straw hats they wear. Everywhere in Congo people, especially 
kids, would shout "Chinois" (Chinese in French) to us. For many 
Congolese everybody who is not black is "Chinois". That is due to the 
large community of Chinese living in Congo.<br>
<br>
The relationship between China and Congo is worrying to say the least. I
 will not bore you to death with the details, but if you are interested,
 do a google search on the deals regarding the mining concessions and 
you will find plenty to read.<br>
In short: China has lend Congo many billions for rebuilding their 
infrastructure. Almost all infrastructure works are then outsourced to..
 Chinese companies. The chinese companies bring their own - underpaid - 
workforce and provide little to no employment to the local population. 
In return for the loan China gets huge mining concessions. Astronomical 
'signature fees' were appointed to the officials who signed the 
contracts ofcourse. The whole deal is immensly beneficial for the 
Chinese, but the question is what is in it for the Congolese?<br>
And what happens when the 5 billion is spent? They'll have a few nice 
roads and bridges. But what about maintenance of this infrastructure?<br>
<br>
After a few police checks (no more talks about the permit here... ) we 
arrive din Kikwit. So many people on the street! Such a big city! We got
 lost a few times but eventually arrived in the mission of the Frère 
Oblats (Oblates). A very energetic Congolese, Frère Jean-Marie welcomes 
us. We had also hoped to meet Frère Léon, a belgian missionary, but 
unfortunately he was in Kinshasa. The mission has Internet access (via 
satelite, only a few hours a day) and a guest house where we set up our 
camp.<br>
<br>
When the darkness fell it was striking how little light we could see in 
this big city. Kikwit has an estimated population in excess of 300.000 
people. But there is no electricity. The rich can afford to run a 
generator for a few hours a day, the rest has to make do with candles, 
oil lamps or nothing at all.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Progress after 31 days since we left Lubumbashi. 36 days since we entered Congo<br>

</blockquote>Hi Amtprod! I guess its the same everywhere in the world, 
even in the 'developed' world. But I have never seen in it such a large 
scale as in DRC. <br>
<br>
Cambodia is a great country. The population there has been trough hell 
and yet they are so friendly and hopeful. Really lovely people! Last 
year we got a bit lost in the Cambodian jungle on our bikes... but 
that's another trip report :bike_rider:</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">I'm off for the weekend. :camping: :bike_rider: Story continues on Monday.<br>
<br>
Sorry ;-)</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 32</b><br>
<br>
We felt at ease here in Kikwit. We could feel the stress of the state of
 roads making place for the stress on how to get our car back in a 
proper condition again. Energetic Frère Jean-Marie came to us with a 
suggestion to use his mechanics. He had two guys who did all the 
maintenance stuff on the mission's vehicles. Fair enough. They made an 
inventory of all the required parts and set off to see if they were 
available and how much they would cost.<br>
<br>
This left us waiting at the mission's guesthouse. They had simple rooms 
for 15$US a night but without mosquito nets. So we camped in the yard 
and used the rooms to have a toilet and a shower (what a luxury!). <br>
<br>
Every morning we were in Kikwit we would get a visit from the same 
souvenir seller. It's the first time we met somebody who sells souvenirs
 in Congo. Not surprisingly as there aren't many people to sell 
souvenirs to. It was an older guy and he had this determination that 
souvenir sellers have. We are always very hesitant of showing interest 
as that means they will not stop trying until you buy something. But we 
gave in in the end as he had some cool looking stuff and he actually 
entertained us quite well. We showed interest in a chess game but could 
not agree on a price. <br>
<br>
Later that day the mechanics came back with a list of parts. Most of the
 parts were not available in Kikwit and would have to be ordered in 
Kinshasa. And the others were just plain expensive. 200$ for a 
chinese-made battery, this reeked. We honestly asked Frère Jean Marie 
about this and he seemed to be a bit embarrased about the topic. He did 
not deny the prices were inflated but he shrugged at it and said we 
could afford it anyway. That was a bit dissapointing because we 
couldn't.<br>
<br>
Then came a phone call. It was Paolo, an Italian working for CTB. We had
 received his contacts earlier and sent him a text message that we were 
in Kikwit. Paolo, being Italian, has this Italian way of talking and 
handling things. Flamboyant is the right word I think. He was the right 
man in the right place for sure!<br>
<br>
Paolo is one of these guys that breath Africa. He had lived and worked 
for many years in Africa, seemingly only in the most horrific troubled 
areas. He lived in Kikwit now. He would help us to try to get a second 
opinion on the parts and at the same time invited us to stay at his 
place. <br>
<br>
That night Paolo took us to a restaurant. The only 'restaurant' in 
Kikwit that served something else then fufu. The only restaurant per se.
 People here do not have a habit of eating out. The restaurant was a bit
 hidden away in a flooded backyard and consisted of little more then a 
few plastic chairs and tables and a makeshift braai. It was owned and 
run by an older Lebanese guy. He had this horrible cough and looked 
terrible as if he could drop dead any minute. A younger Lebanese was 
there too, he had recently arrived 'for business'. I did not ask about 
his business. I probably did not want to know. But he was a nice guy and
 even brought a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hookah" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/forum/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FHookah&amp;hash=324a26823700ed7803002111bd8d5190" rel="nofollow noopener">Sheesha</a>.
 These three were the only 'white people' in Kikwit. They would come 
together almost every night for a greasy meatskewer with french fries. 
It's the only thing there was. I loved it.<br>
<br>
Why is that they only really hanged out with the three of them in a city
 of many hundred thousands? Paolo was married to a Congolese (she lived 
in Kinshasa) so he even spoke the language. The real reason is that once
 you befriend Congolese one gets caught up in the 'favour' mentality. 
You cannot deny a favour to a friend. Paolo, as the responsible for CTB 
had a 'business' to run. He would have hundreds of friends instantly and
 very soon the first 'favours' would be asked. Jobs, material, money. It
 would make it impossible for him to work here. He was friendly to his 
staff and treated them with respect. But he did not befriend them, 
because it would make his life impossible. <br>
<br>
<b>Day 33</b><br>
<br>
The souvenir seller came back and we barthered and joked for another hour but we did not agree on a price.<br>
<br>
Together with Paolo we went to the Technical School of Kikwit (not sure 
of the name, not the one of the Jesuïtes). This is where youngsters get 
their education as mechanics. The teachers had tons of experience and 
should know Landcruisers in-and-out. After some negotiation and thanks 
to Paolo we finally agreed on a price. It was less then half of what we 
were orignally asked for by the other mechanics. And they would start 
the work that same afternoon in the yard of CTB. <br>
<br>
First job was to dismantle both the front and rear axles. The front to 
see what was broken. And the rear to fix the leaking seals and see if we
 could find some planetary gears that were in better condition then the 
ones we bought in Dibaya-Lubwe.<br>
<br>

Front diff had the same problem as the rear one. Only here both the sun and the planetary gears would have to be replaced. <br>

	</div>

<br>
<br>
These would need to be ordered from Kinshasa and flown in. That's not easy task to get organized.<br>
<br>
By now we also nearly ran out of cash.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">We
 had contacted the homefront with the question if they could find a way 
of getting money to us. Western Union and the likes would only do 
transactions to Kinshasa, but not to Kikwit. The fees Western Union 
charges are also pretty ridiculous. In the end we managed to get in 
contact with a Belgian lady in Kinshasa who owns a big company there. 
Our familiy would transfer the money to her Belgian account. As soon as 
she had received the money she would hand the money in US$ over to a 
contact we had in Kinshasa. That contact would then buy the parts we 
need, box it and put it on an airplane to Kikwit. Easy!  :roll: <br>
<br>
That night we were introduced to Timothé, Paolo's cuisinier. Timothé had
 this angry way of talking and looking, but friendly at the same time. 
He had special skills. Paolo (and his predecessor in Kikwit) had learned
 him the art of Italian cooking. He could cook up a pasta - from local 
ingredients - that an Italian would not critisize... and that is a 
feature! He was probably the best Italian chef in DRC!<br>
 <br>
<b>Day 34</b><br>
<br>
The souvenir seller was back that morning, he was in a bit of a hurry 
because a UN convoy would come for a day visit today. A quick round of 
haggling but we did not agree on a price.<br>
<br>
We made use of the privacy Paolo's house provided to finally relax a 
bit. It's been a hectic month for us! Josephine decided that now was a 
good time to get rid of my beard and the carpet on my head. After 40 
days of neglect, I couldn't agree more<br>
<br>

	</div>

<br>
<br>
While we waited for the money transfer and the parts to arrive we 
explored a bit of Kikwit (without a camera, we were suspicious enough 
already). In the city center 'on the hill' is an area that must have 
once been a very posh area. I could see the plush gardens and big 
villa's in my imagination, it was now transformed into rundown 
buildings. Green walls and makeshift corrugated roofs.<br>
<br>
There was a recent asphalt road connecting the RN1 to the airport and 
across the only bridge over the Kwilu river. Most of the other roads had
 varying kinds of decaying asphalt or just dirt. On the asphalt road in 
town there were 'road works'. A big pile of sand was blocking the road 
with just a narrow path to get a car trough. They had made a toll booth 
ofcourse. Paolo told us the pile of sand was there now for over 4 years.
 They would constantly dig away and move the pile back and forth. There 
were no works, the road underneath the sand was perfectly fine.<br>
<br>
Next to the river were a few 'bars'. A few plastic chairs and a cooler 
with hot drinks (no electricity-no money for ice). The owner of the bar 
was really glad to see us. He was complaining about business, the prices
 of basic goods had gone up recently and even less people now had a 
budget to go for a drink.<br>
<br>
The price of eggs had gone up too. Josephine went to buy eggs at the 
small mission of the sisters. They too were complaining as they actually
 had too many eggs. They did not dare to reduce the price as that would 
make the other 'eggsalesman' angry. But it was clear that people could 
no longer afford eggs now. The sisters kept a monkey as a pet. It was a 
vicious monkey. Strange pet!<br>
<br>
The mechanics fixed what they could without the missing parts (the 
gears, one hub for the rear axle + all the bolt required for the hub). 
We got hold of two new batteries. Indian made this time. 100$ a pop. 
They were junk but it worked for now.<br>

<b>Day 35 - 36 - 37</b><br>
<br>
The souvenir guy came every day, a bit of haggling, a bit of talking. But we could not agree on a price.<br>
<br>
We waited and generaly had an enjoyable stay in Kikwit... Paolo is one 
the most interesting persons we ever met. You should hear his stories!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">

Frederik, is this the same road you took?

	</div>
</blockquote>Nice video. It is more or less the same road yes. We did 
not go via Kolwezi, but took an alternative track before kolwezi (the 
part with the private roads). Most of the road must have been similar 
though.<br>
<br>
It's interesting to see that the camera crew probably did not expect it 
would take that long and did not make it until the end. As you see, it's
 quite common that journeys into the Congo take a bit longer then a few 
hours. We reached Bukama (the destination of this truck)after a few 
days. After Bukama traffic virtually stops at all. Nobody really 
continues past there. You'd have to be nuts to do that really ;-) <br>
<br>
Also interesting to see that they have 3 guys as pointers for the 
driver. They walk the road and make the decisions. This was Josephine's 
role in the Congo, and she was on her own obviously. The importance of 
her role cannot be underestimated!<br>
<br>
I should add that Josephine usually does a fair bit of driving as well. 
As I have a bit more experience with technical driving, I did all the 
driving in Congo. Many days she walked more in front of the car then she
 was in it.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 38</b><br>
<br>
Guess who was there that morning? Yep! We talked about that nifty 
looking handmade chessgame, but we couldn't agree on a price...<br>
<br>
The whole money transfer thing went pretty smoothly. It is quite amazing
 really. We just rang up a lady in Kinshasa we have never met and asked 
her if she could give us a 1000$US please. She obviously waited until 
the money was on her Belgian account but she then gave the money to some
 other guy in Kinshasa. Another person we had never met who was now 
walking around with 1000$US of our money in Kinshasa. Shopping around 
for spare parts based on a list with spare part numbers. (we had. the 
Toyota EPC on our laptop). He used our money to pay for the parts, pay 
for the airfreight into Kikwit and holds on to the rest of the money 
until we come and pick it up later. An amazing amount of trust was 
involved in these transactions! And all of that thanks to the contacts 
we created in Lubumbashi. Amazing! Great thanks to Paolo, Erwin, Thièrry
 &amp; Valerie!<br>
<br>
The airplane that flew our parts in was one of those two engined LET 
L-410's. They have a really bad reputation because of the many crashes 
they make. Everybody here tries to avoid them as much as possible. One 
of the latest crashes made the International news (the crocodile crash):
 <a href="http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8078612/Aircraft-crashes-after-crocodile-on-board-escapes-and-sparks-panic.html" target="_blank" class="link link--external" data-proxy-href="/forum/proxy.php?link=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.telegraph.co.uk%2Fnews%2Fworldnews%2Fafricaandindianocean%2Fdemocraticrepublicofcongo%2F8078612%2FAircraft-crashes-after-crocodile-on-board-escapes-and-sparks-panic.html&amp;hash=02371aec8e28e5df6f9a9b41a5b95f55" rel="nofollow noopener">http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/africaandindianocean/democraticrepublicofcongo/8078612/Aircraft-crashes-after-crocodile-on-board-escapes-and-sparks-panic.html</a><br>
<br>
It was now just a matter to get all the parts mounted. As usual, that 
did not really go as planned. We had ordered a new hub and new bolts to 
keep the sideshaft in place. But they shipped us the bolts (and the 
important conic washers) for the Landcruiser 79. Which are different in 
size from the 75. I was not going to drill my brand new hub to make them
 fit so we had set out again to find some second-hand bolts. We 
eventually found a few that fit, it would be good to get us to Kinshasa,
 but they would have to replaced again in Kinshasa. What a great 
prospect: even more time to be spent in a greasy workshop! <br>
We still hadn't found decent quality oil. I had really tried my best to 
find diff oil where it was not explicitly stated "Not for use in cars". 
The local mechanic said they never change the diff or gearbox oil on new
 cars. The oil that's put in from the fabric is superior with the oil 
they can replace it with. They just top up, but never change. When a 
diff has to be openen, they recycle the original oil.<br>
<br>
That brought us on the topic of cars the NGO's and the missions here 
use. The cars that are deployed in the jungle have a lifespan of no more
 then 15 to 20.000km. After that they are completely shot. Bodywork, 
drivetrain, everything. Not surprising really considering the state of 
the loads and the payloads. Paolo was quite fanatical in his choice for 
those vehicles: Landcruiser 7x only! The Landcruiser 10* are often used 
as well, but they don't last on the rough tracks (too much bodywork). He
 once worked on a project were they had sponsored Mitsubishi's. They

Plants start growing on our sidesteps!<br>
<br>
Tomorrow would be the big day. Kikwit to Kinshasa can be done in a day, a
 6 to 8 hour drive, depending on the weather (and consequently the state
 of the road). We'd start early as the closer you get to Kinshasa, the 
dodgier it gets. Not that it's really dangerous, just the usual problem 
areas that accompany large cities. We just hoped that all the repairs 
would hold up.<br>
<br>
We had already said our goodbyes to everybody we met in Kikwit.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 39</b><br>
<br>
Our favourite souvenir seller was there again. By now we actually got 
quite fond of his chessgame. I cannot remember his asking price but 
after all these days of haggling he was still at the same price! He 
hadn't dropped his price with a single franc! We could talk to him for 
hours. Providing arguments to drop his price, but at the end of the 
conversation he would just keep repeating the original price with a smug
 smile on his face. An amazing guy this was. He knew we were leaving 
that day so we made him a final offer. Way more then what it was worth 
and what we were actually prepared to spend on something we really 
didn't need. He accepted, and while he counted his money he moppered 
about how he couldn't feed his wive<b>s</b> and children. He gave us fat
 wink at the end. We got tricked into buying something we didn't want 
for a price we did not want. But he did it so good we didn't even feel 
bad about it. ;-)<br>
<br>
It was time to go. The final stretch to Kinshasa. We had to get 
organized again in Kinshasa. Fix up our car a bit better. Organize a few
 visa's. Organize the bac (ferry) across the Congo river to Brazzavile 
and generally prepare for our final trek north, back to Belgium. 
15.000km north, all the way trough Africa. We knew that road north, we 
had already taken it earlier in this trip in the other direction. This 
would be our third North-South crossing of the African continent in the 
same trip... a sad one as it would also mean our 'big trip' would be 
almost over.<br>
<br>
The asphalt road leading out of Kikwit was pretty darn good. And pretty darn straight too.<br>
<br>

<br>
<br>
But only a very small part of the road is tarred. Most of it sandy, but 
it is maintained (by the UN mostly). Some stretches are fast, some are 
rutted and the known bogholes usually have good detours. Despite this 
being one of the best roads we had travelled over since entering the 
Congo, we were still a bit nervous. For the first time since long we had
 set a goal for the day - Kinshasa - and we would be dissapointed if we 
did not make it today. <br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">39 days after we rolled out of 
Lubumbashi, we limped into Kinshasa. People who have driven around 
Kinshasa will surely recognize the tension that is always present in the
 city, to us it felt like coming home. This "Kinshasa tension" is so 
much tamer the "interior-of-Congo tension". Strange how perceptions 
change during a trip. The previous time we were in Kinshasa we were 
pretty impressed with this 'tension' and did not feel at ease at all. 
Granted, it might have had something to do with the elections that were 
going on at that time.<br>
<br>
The other reason it felt like coming home was because of the great 
reception we had from Erwin &amp; Diana. We had met Erwin in Lubumbashi 
(he was visiting there) and they lived here. Not only were they 
genuinely nice people. They also knew how to cook a genuine Belgian 
meal. Never before have I enjoyed "hesperollekes met kaassaus" before!<br>

	</div></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 40 - 41 - 42 - 43 - 44 - 45</b><br>
<br>
We had a lot of things to do in Kinshasa. We did not have a visa yet to 
get out of the country (Congo-Brazzaville). And to avoid having to drive
 all the way to Franceville in Gabon we already applied for our Cameroon
 visa too. Gabon did not want to give us a visa for reasons not really 
clear to us. We would have to apply for that visa in Brazza. This whole 
process takes a few days.<br>
<br>
Then there was the car. On the road from kikwit to Kinshasa we had 
noticed our rear differential was leaking again. Problem is the seal and
 the liquid sealant they use here. Normally there is a rubber gasket, 
but nobody stocks this gasket in the entire DRC. A lot of differentials 
here are leaking, that's for sure. We had to buy a sheet of plasticky 
gasket material and cut one out ourselves. A lengthy task. At the same 
time we had to get our lights fixed, most of them were smashed up by 
now. And then there were the brakes that still had to replaced (although
 I got quite good at driving without brakes now. It's an art in itself!)
 and it was about time to change all the filters too.<br>
<br>
Somehow we managed to engange the most horrible mechanic we have ever 
met. We actually went to some sort of 'upmarket' workshop as we wanted 
to get things fixed properly this time. The manager was a nice guy, 
unfortunatly his chief-mechanic, a Lebanese youngster, was nothing more 
then a prick. He treated his mechanics as slaves and was uncapable of 
doing anything useful himself. He 'fixed up' our electrics. He could not
 find the reason why the fuse of the brake light kept jumping. His 
solution was to bypass the fuse. He declared it fixed and ofcourse did 
not tell us he had bypassed that fuse. We almost lost our car to the 
flames a few days later when a fire started behind the dashboard when 
the stoplight wiring shorted out again. <br>
<br>
It was pretty cool to find some western goods again. We could not really
 afford much of it, as prices here are prohibitively expensive. Kinshasa
 ranks high up the list of most expensive cities in the world (right 
next to Luanda). This is because the country is so unstable that all 
businesses are high-risk business. Building a house to rent it out? 
You'd better make sure you get your investment back within a few years 
time, before the next ransacking starts, or before some official claims 
your house. Running a business? Better account for all the theft, the 
bribes, etc and include it in your margin. <br>
<br>
When all was done (well.. more or less done) we were ready to hit the 
road. This little ride in the Congo was quite something, but it was time
 to explore other regions now.<br>
<br>
We drove to 'le beach' the ferryport in Kinshasa. Only to notice that is
 was remarkebly quiet here. Not the usual bustle that is going on here.<br>
The bac (ferry) was not running. "Problème administratif". We couldn't 
find out the exact reason, but we were not leaving Kinshasa today! <br>
<br>
"Peut-être demain" - "Maybe tomorrow"<br>
<br>
The bac to Brazzavile is the only way to get out of Kinshasa and into Congo-Brazzaville.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>Day 46</b><br>
<br>
We tried again to take the ferry. It was still not running. Some 
paperwork was not in order to release the ferry and apparantly the 
official who had to sign the document could not be located. Both ferries
 were stuck on the other side. Maybe that afternoon.<br>
<br>
We came back that afternoon: Nope.<br>
<br>
<b>Day 47</b><br>
<br>
Great news: all the paperwork was done. But today was an official holiday in Congo. Nobody worked that day... so no ferry<br>
<br>
<b>Day 48</b><br>
<br>
We were finally able to board the ferry. We had previously used the 
other ferry which are three boats attached to eachother (in a rather 
dodgy way). This time we took the bigger ferry. Bigger did not mean we 
had more space. As the ferry hadn't run for a few days there was a lot 
of stuff that needed to get across.<br>

The ferry's diesel engine made a slow rythmic noise and struggled to 
push the heavy ferry upstream over the Congo river. The skyline of 
Kinshasa became smaller with every beat.<br>

(Keep reading, wrap-up and more background information still to come)</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><span style="font-size: 15px"><b>The Wrap-up</b></span><br>
<br>
<span style="font-size: 10px"><span style="font-size: 9px">(It's going 
to be long... sorry. I normally don't like to be so serious, but I feel I
 have started something and I have to finish it. If you're only 
interested in the technical bits, they are the end)</span></span><br>
<br>
<b>So is that what Congo is really like?</b><br>
<br>
Ofcourse not! This is what Congo could be like if you try to drive a 4x4 from Lubumbashi to Kinshasa. <br>
In the beginning of the rainy season.<br>
Unsupported. <br>
In 2008.<br>
After being on the road non-stop for more then 600 days travelling half of the world.<br>
...<br>
<br>
That is a very specific situation and leads to very specific events with
 specific people who show a specific behaviour. It can hardly draw a 
representative picture about the Congo, about us or about overland 
travel in general. (I feel like I am writing a typical American 
disclaimer here, please don't put your children in the microwave oven! <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite8" alt=":D" title="Big grin    :D" data-shortname=":D"> )<br>
<br>
<b>The important bit here is: it's a trip report. Nothing more nothing less.</b> I have told the events as they have happened. I have added the extra dimension to describe our feelings and thoughts <b>at that moment</b>.
 I have no hidden agenda. I am not trying to push my own 
agenda/principles/opinions on you. I am not paid to write this trip 
report nor am I representing some company whose interest I might be 
defending. My job or my future does not depend on it. As a result I have
 no reason to paint a nicer, or worse,  picture then how it really was. I
 have been very honest about everything that has happened and made 
ourselves very vulnerable for critisism at that as I also do not hide 
our mistakes. It is also important to note that we are not complaining 
or whining when we repeat certain things (the corruption, the bribes, 
..). Those are just the things that happened, I tell them how it 
happened and how we felt <b>at that moment</b>. When all is said and 
done you must certainly not forget that this report is just a simple 
unambitious report. Not an opinion article in your favourite magazine. 
Not an official report describing humanity in Congo. Not an overland 
handbook on how to traverse the Congo and interact with the 'locals'. 
Oh.. and English is my third language, so sorry about the spelling!<br>
<br>
The result is a very crude story. Certainly not a happy story. You might
 even have a foul taste in your mouth when reading certain passages. 
Because of the description of the misery. Because of our behaviour.<br>
<br>
Please, allow me to add a bit more perspective and hopefully make you 
understand - if only a little - the view of Congo we gave trough our 
eyes. <br>
<br>
<b>What happened before you entered Congo?</b><br>
<br>
The complete answer is ofcourse impossibly long, but I feel it is 
important to summarize a bit what we have been up to before, as I think 
some people think the Congo story is a stand-alone event where we flew 
in and when it was done flew back out again. An impulsive plan just for 
the sake of adventure. It wasn't.<br>
<br>
in 2006 we sold all our belongings (literally: ALL), quit our jobs, took
 all of our saving money and decided to go on a little trip. We had done
 our homework during the many months/years we had saved up for it and 
bought and prepared a Landcruiser. (I will go into further detail on the
 preperations later on). We planned to travel for 1 year. People who 
have done this too will certainly remember the moment when you say 
goodbye to all your family and friends knowing you will not see them for
 an entire year. That is a big decision to make. We travelled overland, 
25.000km down Africa (west route) and after 9 months found ourselves in 
South Africa. We liked the travelling so much and found it such a pitty 
that we had such little time left to drive back that we started counting
 our money: Lo-and-behold, if we didn't do crazy stuff we could extend 
our 1 year trip with another year. We shipped our car to Japan and from 
there drove trough Siberian Russia, Mongolia, Central Asia (all the 
*stan countries), the middle east back to Africa. Once there, we really 
longed to visit the East side of Africa and while we were at it we could
 visit DRC, a country that I have dreamed and read about for so long. So
 that is what we did. After the traverse of DRC we would find ourselves 
back on the westcoast and we would drive back north as central as 
possible (via Niger-Algeria) which was a pretty daunty route in 2008. We
 travelled for 715 days non-stop. 100.000km. We never went home or even 
set foot on the European continent during that time. In fact, we did not
 have a 'home' apart from our car. We had crossed dozens of remote 
deserts, driven trough some of the most barren mountain ranges in the 
world, hacked ourway trough many jungles. Returned on our paths many 
times when we though we were risking it too much. Always unsupported. 
Always with the two of us. Always with the same car.<br>
<br>
We had been in Kinshasa the first time in 2006 with the plan to drive to
 Lubumbashi. We had done our preperations and were ready. But then the 
elections came and Kinshasa transformed into a war zone, and lef the 
rest of the country as unstable as it could be. We rushed out of the 
country towards Angola at that time.<br>
<br>
By no means do we consider ourselves experienced travellers or experts 
in Africa or "Third World problems" (and certainly not in their 
solutions). The first months of our trip were quite difficult. Learning 
to adapt to the cultural differences, how to deal with officials, 
bribes, corruption. Seeing and living between poor people. Seeing the 
influence foreign aid has (good and bad). Seeing the attitude of people 
change when crossing country borders... when crossing continents. After a
 while we got the hang of it. It's a continuous search for balance and 
when you think you found it, things change again and you need to rethink
 everything all over again. It never ends. But that's allright for us. 
We did stupid things every single day. We still do. We have always done.
 But we do try to learn from our mistakes.<br>
<br>
<b>You just did this for your own pleasure? What about supporting a good cause?</b><br>
<br>
We prepared this trip for many, many months so ofcourse this topic came 
across. Many people do it. But if you dig a bit deeper one really needs 
sponsorship to get started. We have also seen people who only do the 
good cause thing to get sponsorship. Fair enough, they get a few bits 
and pieces to bolt onto their car and in return raise a bit of money for
 some NGO in return. Usually not too much, but every bit helps. A 
win-win situation. But this did not fully convince me. I do not feel 
comfortable with sponsorship if I have the feeling I am not retuning 
something valuable. I am just not good at selling myself(and too 
honest). I also don't like a car plastered with stickers when travelling
 around, it draws way too much attention. I also feel uncomfortable with
 many NGO's. There are many, many good projects, but there are probably 
an equal amount of nonsense projects as well. If I attach my name to a 
project, I want it to be a genuine project. To make a long story short I
 am not good at this entire sponsorship/aid thing and would probably 
have made a mess of it. That does not make us heroes, but that is 
allright because we are no heroes.<br>
<br>
<b>How can you travel trough such impoverished countries without 
providing them with some sort of aid? Be it money or supplies or 
volunteer work?</b><br>
<br>
I felt guilty about that in the beginning, certainly when we decided not
 to attach support to some good cause to our trip. But why was that? <br>
<br>
Why is it that we have no problem spending millions on a house and a new
 car. Eat out, wear fancy clothes. Go on a beach holiday to the other 
side of the world. And never feel guilty about it? But as soon as we set
 foot in poor-poor Africa that attitude changes and we feel we MUST 
provide aid. We could all cancel that Internet subscription we have and 
send that money to Africa every month. A ridiculous thought ofcourse... 
but yet, we cannot set foot on African soil without bringing a stash of 
old clothes, a gazillion of pens and feel best about it when our car is 
plastered in stickers from NGO's. Not that there is anything wrong with 
that (well, sometimes there a few things wrong with that), but why do we
 feel as if it is a necessity?<br>
<br>
Isn't there a poor part of our hometown? Don't we ever pass trough there? Do we support these local causes? <br>
Do we feel guilty when we see a begger in our hometown? Do we have the 
instant reflex to give that begger a ridiculously large amount of money 
and a pen? Ofcourse not, because we are afraid he'll spend it on a 
bottle of liquor from the nightshop. But why don't we care about what 
happens to the aid we all sent to Africa? Ever been to a market in 
Africa? You can buy your donated T-shirt back and all the pens we have 
thrown out of the window when blasting past.<br>
<br>
Give sweets to children? You'll get paid with an instant smile and it 
will make you feel realy good about yourself. Do you also give them 
toothpaste and brush? Pay the dentist? Do you know these kids can earn 
more by looking sad at the side of the road then their parents earn 
working? Parents actually stop sending them to school and make them 
stand at the side of the road as it is so profitable. So by giving a 
sweet to a kid you could have potentially been (partly) responsible for 
it dropping out of school and waisiting all chances of a good future. 
Far fetched you think? Not really I'm afraid. I have seen that 
first-hand in several countries. Does that mean you cannot do something 
as simple as give a sweet to a kid? Ofcourse you can. But in our 
hometowns, we don't just give sweets to children we don't know, do we? 
We usually even ask at the parents if we can. Providing aid requires a 
bit more then just giving away a few things. That is what makes it so 
hard when you are constantly on the move. Now substitue sweet with any 
other thing you would like to donate.<br>
<br>
I can go on for a long time with questions like that.. There is SO much 
that can go wrong with providing aid. That is ofcourse no reason not to 
provide aid, but at least we should appreciate the fact that it is a bit
 more complicated then we would like to think. I have no answers, I 
don't know how to do it 'right'. I try my best in own way and I can only
 hope others do the same.<br>
<br>
Jay Leno, of all people, once said: "In America, we like everybody to 
know about the good work we do anonymously". The in America bit is not 
important(replace it with 'western world' maybe?), but the rest is. He 
said this about why the Toyota Prius was so popular while he thought it 
was not really saving the planet at all. It's all about image. <br>
Sensitive topics. Who doesn't want to save the planet? Who doesn't want 
to do something about poverty in Africa? The reality is, we don't do 
much <b>AT ALL</b>, but we want to keep up the image. And we even 
convince ourselves that we do. And preferably we want to boast about it 
on the Internet, show off on our websites, talk about it on forums. We 
want to write books about it, want to discuss it. We want everyone to 
know how important WE think it is. And preferably at the same time 
belittle people whom we think don't do enough. And you know what, at the
 end of the day there is no more time, money or resources left to 
actually do something about it. But we sleep good at night ofcourse, 
it's the others who failed, not us! And we have a portfolio to prove it!<br>
<br>
This is ofcourse very unfair to the many people who are actually helping
 out on the field. Or assisting with logistics from abroad. As always it
 is very unfair to generalize. People like Frère Louis we met in Congo 
is one of these people. Their generosity and engagement is endless. I 
have immense respect for him. Nobody knows about him ofcourse... he's 
too busy doing 'the good thing'. He is definitaly somebody worth 
supporting in any way possible. If you really want to donate, I think 
that is the way to go. Find a reliable organisation person and give it 
them with as little in-between people as possible. Who would have 
thought that providing aid would be such hard work eh? <br>
<br>
So how does that correlate to our adventure in Congo? The reality is: 
there was very little we could on the ground. We did not have the time, 
we did not have the money, we did not have the supplies. Time, money and
 supplies, all of it can be generated. But for us, at that time, it was 
not possible. Period.<br>
<br>
The everyday little gestures(giving and receiving) don't usually make 
our trip reports. They are just the most normal things in the world - 
not worth mentioning(at least not for the right reasons). If we receive 
exceptional hospitality, we will write about it. I we provide 
exceptional help, we will (probably) write about it. If you do not read 
many good experiences in our trip report... that's because they did not 
happen and I did not want to make the little gestures - both directions -
 look bigger then they really were. <br>
<br>
I wrote the anecdote of the guy on a little motorbike who asked for oil.
 If I had just given it to him and nothing would have happened I would 
not have written about it. I wrote about it because it struck me that I 
was so hard at that time to him. The whole series of events prior to 
that situation made me act that way. I do not approve my behaviour. I 
felt bad for that guy afterwords, I wished I would have reacted 
otherwise. But put me in exactly the same situation and I would react 
exactly the same. That's the whole point: Congo changed our normal 
behaviour. Nowhere in Africa (or elsewhere) had we experienced this to 
such an extent. That is what I write about. That is also why I dared 
referencing to Conrad's book.<br>
<br>
Have you noticed how little this entire explication actually takes the 
Congolese (or other benificiaries of our aid) opinion into account? It 
does not seem to matter much in most discussions I have seen. I often 
make the mistake of forgetting that all this aid we are discussing is 
actually meant for a real live person. And I don't think I am alone. So 
what is his idea about all this aid stuff? Do we actually care when, for
 the umpteenth time, we have this discussion? Or do we think we are 
expert enough to know his opinion without asking?<br>
<br>
<b>Ok, but why don't you pay for services you receive? Why do you expect freebies from some of the poorest people in the world?</b><br>
<br>
That seems to be a hot topic for many people and for starters I would 
like to recommend to reread my report again. Because asking something 
for free is something I never do. I don't even dare it at home. That 
does not mean I will not accept anything for free if people insist. But 
asking? Sorry, no. Expecting? Even less.<br>
<br>
I am very proud on the way we take our responsibility if we take risks. 
We often take risks (as you might have noticed), but never will we not 
accept the concequences. We got stuck hundreds of time and we knew we 
would before we entered Congo. We always started working our way out on 
our own. We did not ask for help when we thought we did not need it, and
 we rarely did. Yes, I did get cross when people begged when we were 
digging. But it's not like they were offering help in return for money, 
they were just begging. Was it friendly to be cross? Ofcourse not.. but 
hey, I am a human being like all of us you know.<br>
<br>
If we get offered help (we did not ask, remember) in return for money 
and we do not really need it, we usually decline. Our experience tells 
us that we lose more time with negotiating about the price then with 
fixing it ourselves. Our experience in Congo tells us that, unlike most 
other parts of Africa, the asking price will be insanely high to start 
with anyway and the discussions will probably be very heated (we have to
 think about our security too). Does that mean we have denied them the 
chance for a quick job? It certainly does!  But it is just impossible, 
and dangerous, to proceed like that all the time. That is the reality 
and sorry to dissapoint you that it does not correspond to what you 
would have liked us to do.<br>
<br>
What if people started helping us, why did I tell them they would not 
get any money? Unlike us, westerners, these people do not need fancy 
contracts with addendums and disclaimers. They know perfectly well what I
 am saying. They also know I am a mundele who might not know the regular
 customs, so they take a very small risk that they will not actually 
receive anything. But these people are not stupid. Nor are they 
ignorant. They know they will get rewarded. They know they will get 
rewarded more then if they would be helping a fellow Congolese. But it 
will not the be the 'Grand Prize' they had hoped for in the beginning.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper"><b>But why don't you pay them the 'Grand Prize"? For you it's almost nothing</b><br>

I have read this trip report from a backpacker a long time ago. I can't 
remember his name or website so I cannot give credit. But he told of 
something that had happened to him in a south-east asian capital city. 
It went something like this (free interpretation)<br>
<br>

			While walking around I was stopped by a guy selling little drums. I 
quite fancied them so I asked how much. He wanted 5$. That's virtually 
for free, I could buy twenty of them with the money I had in my pocket! I
 knew it was normal to talk the price down, but I hated that so much. I 
did a quick attempt and got the price down to 4$. Hey, what's 4$ to me 
anyway? And the salesman looked happy!<br>
<br>
A few moments later a man came to talk to me. He introduced himself as a
 professor at the local university. He had seen how I bought the drums 
and he was quite upset. He asked me if I know something about economics?
 "Sure", I answered, after all I studied economics at school. He then 
went on to explain me a bit about the simple principle of supply and 
demand.<br>
<br>
- The real value of the drums is 0,5$. And expensive item for local people, but if they saved up they could just afford one.<br>
- I had now bought a drum for 4$. The salesman was really pleased with 
that. He also saw that this western tourist gladly paid it.<br>
- If that salesman could sell 1 drum to a western tourist, he would earn
 8 times more then if he would sell it to a local. The idea of selling 
locally suddenly became a lot less attractive!<br>
- Because of the principle of suply and demand, the value of that drum was now 4$.<br>
- Local people could not afford to spend 4$ on a drum. They would no longer be able to purchase one.

</blockquote>This is ofcourse oversimplified, but I think it holds some 
truth. Let's create the following fictionial, but not unrealistic, 
situation:<br>
<br>
There is a big boghole. We get stuck. We ask for help. It takes them a 
long time and its hard work, but in the end we pay them 600$ After all, 
that is what it would have cost us in the US if we called a tow truck 
and these guys worked hard. We can afford 600$, we came prepared with a 
lot of money for cases like this.<br>
<br>
Guess what happens when the next truck arrives and gets stuck? They will
 not ask 600$ because they know they can get that. They ask 1200$ as it 
is quite normal to double the initial asking price. How much will that 
truck be able to talk it down?<br>
<br>
And what about the fact that in this little village there is now 1 guy 
who owns 600$ while the rest his village owns nothing at all. Imagine 
the turmoil that is going to cause? It is not going to be pretty! (that 
was one  the underlying messages from "The gods must be crazy" if I am 
not mistaken.)<br>
<br>
The consequences of paying 400%, 500%, 600%, ... more then the normal 
going rates is quite dramatic. Not just to you, but to the economy. And 
it only enforces the image that all "whites" are rich and stupid (and 
can be treated as such). We are very much aware that we ALWAYS paid more
 then what locals would have paid. We don't mind. But we made sure we 
kept it reasonable.<br>
<br>
Having said all that. No we were not surprised to see the attitude from 
the locals towards us. We had seen it many times elsewhere. But yes, the
 sheer scale of it surprised us. <br>
<br>
In dibaya-lubwe we had a (very friendly) conversation with a group of 
young, curious and intelligent guys. They asked how many mobile phones 
we had. That question surprised us. And our answer (one) surprised them.
 They asked how many mobile phone networks there were? We have 3 in 
Belgium. So why didn't we have 3 mobile phones then? "In Belgium the 
mobile phones are for free and you do not have to pay for the 
conversations". They honestly believed that! Where do they get that kind
 of information? Why do they think things like that? Why do they even 
consider believing it? Not surprising really if the few white people 
they have met are spending money as if they get it for free.<br>
<br>
I can go on forever and I notice this is getting more into a rant then into background information. For which I apologize.<br>
<br>
<b>But you don't pay the official fees either?</b><br>
<br>
I see 'The Internet' has accused us of not paying the toll fees in 
Lubumbashi. Please, once again, reread the trip report, I actually 
explained why. I also explained why us normally do pay them. I am not 
going to repeat it here.<br>
<br>
<b>Some other random thing you should have done better. Why are you so arrogant about *random thing*?</b><br>
<br>
It saddens me that some people have the impression that we are angry in 
everything we do. That we wildly kick about but are generally clueless. I
 can only say: we're not really like that. Honestly! ;-)<br>
<br>
I hope you understand by now that there are little things we do/did that
 we do not think about. So much even that I often get completely fed up 
with it all, as I do not know the answers to all these difficult 
questions I keep asking myself. And I hope you understand that the 
situation in Congo is quite exceptional. It cannot be compared to other 
African countries. It is certainly not representative Even with the best
 intentions and the best preperations, once you are down there, crawling
 out of your capsized 4x4 things change. I am sure psychologist can 
explain this very well.<br>
<br>
We really try hard to be responsible in our travels. Travelling means 
everything to us. The impressions we leave are as dear to us as the 
impressions we gained during our trips. Our opinions constantly change. 
But we are not Mother Theresa. This whole idea that travelling trough 
the third wolrd dictates that we must act like saints makes me very 
tired. We are normal persons, who do normal things. We just like to do 
those things in unusual places I guess ;-)<br>
<br>
When I initially started writing this trip report I planned on writing a
 very brief item about everything I said above. Due to the surprising 
amount of attention this report got and the surprising amount of 
(sometimes very negative) reactions I felt obliged to do it a bit more 
elaborate. Sorry if I bored you with that.<br>
<br>
The reason why I wanted to keep it short initialy is because I know from
 experience this would start a pointless dicussion. Everybody has their 
own opinions about it. Strong emotions are usually involved. I sometimes
 think it is because it handles about solidarity. And solidarity is 
something we get fed from our religion (be it Christian, Muslim, ...). 
And you know how people are when they see opinions that do not stroke 
with their religion..<br>
<br>
It's a discussion usually held in a pub. And when the beers start 
flowing, the discussion gets heated and ends in a fistfight. The next 
day everybody will feel embarrased for what they have said and done, but
 nobody will apologize because they are too proud. In the end nothing is
 accomplished except some dented ego's. And the topic of the discussion?
 You know, those poor souls in Africa? Nothing will have changed for 
them...<br>
<br>
For that reason, I agree that this belongs in Fireside Chat.

Before you respond in that thread I have one favour to ask. Or make that two. <br>
Firstly, don't take this all too seriously, it's just a silly trip report. <br>
Secondly, wait 24 hours before you reply. How can one reply to such a heated matter seconds after they have read this?<br>
<br>
But you don't have to ofcourse... it's a free world!<br>

</blockquote>Allow me to add the perspective of the author a trip report.<br>
<br>
Writing a trip report like this is a lot of work. I dare not count the 
hours I spent on it. Like most people here I have a huge list of things I
 want to do, but only so much time to do it in. Yet I chose to spent 
some of my valuable (to me) time in writing the trip report. I do not 
get paid for it. I am not obliged to do this. The only reason I do this 
is out of passion for the travelling, and the will to share this passion
 with others. It actually costs me money too, the bandwith of all these 
pictures is not for free you know.<br>
<br>
I do not expect anything in return for this. I do not expect a thank 
you. Ofcourse, positive comments are nice to receive and it will 
motivate me to post more trip reports. Snotty remarks will make me think
 twice before I post another report. Or will change the way I write my 
reports (in a defensive way instead of an open and honest way). <br>
<br>
I know quite a few travellers out there. They have stories to tell that 
would make my little trip report look pretty boring. But they do not 
share them on the Expedition Portal. Partly because they are not so 
Internet minded like I am. But mostly because they know they will have 
to deal with all the silly remarks and questions. They fear that they 
either have to endure the remarks and get branded or spent A LOT of time
 trying to explain everthing they do. These people have better things to
 do... so they do not bother with it. Our loss!<br>
<br>
The thing is, these people are usually willing to share their stories. 
And Expedition Portal would be a great site to do it on. It has 
everything it needs: a huge userbase (audience), great knowledgable and 
interested people, ... . <br>
<br>
ADVrider is a nice example where a constant trickle of extremely 
interesting trip reports. Some time ago MetalJockey posted one of his 
epic trip reports where he took his little kid on the back of the bike. 
The first thing that crossed my mind was that he was going to get a lot 
of comments on taking a kid on the back of a dirt bike with minimal 
protection. Sure enough, remarks came in, but they were extremely 
civilised and contained no judgements (and the others were moderated 
out). Things like:<br>
<br>




<blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent ">
			"What are your experience with taking a kid on a trip like this?"
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</blockquote>That is a very different question then (for example):<br>
<br>




<blockquote class="bbCodeBlock bbCodeBlock--expandable bbCodeBlock--quote">
	
	<div class="bbCodeBlock-content">
		
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandContent ">
			"I don't understand this. I would never take my kid like that. Don't 
you see it's dangerous? There are so many other ways to travel with your
 kids, so why did you do it this way?"

</blockquote>Spot the difference? The first will probably get you an 
answer. The latter will annoy the author, push him into the defence and 
he will certainly think again before sharing something with you again. 
With you, and the community you are part of. You might not get all the 
information you want out of a trip report, but if an author of a trip 
report feels appreciation, you have a much bigger chance he will 
eventually check out the technical forums as well and contribute there. 
Short term vs. long term thinking.<br>
<br>
Does that mean you are not entitled to voice your opinion? That you 
cannot question what has happened? Ofcourse not, but do not forget 
everything you say - and how you say - has consequences. <br>
<br>
Do not take this personally RMPO, I am convinced you have nothing but 
good intentions. I just make use of the opportunity to make a general 
point. Why don't we make this Trip Report section of the forum a nice 
and welcome place for authors of trip reports? We would all benefit from
 it.</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">A screenshot of the GPS data we

<br>
<br>
You can see from our track that we covered 3067km in total. While the road should actually be something like 2300km. <br>
<br>
A note on the road, if you are planning to drive yourself: the situation
 has changed quite a bit since 2008. You might have noticed we had most 
problems north of Kananga. We had little choice at the time because of 
the "coupeurs de route" and because the ferry in Tshikapa was not 
functional.<br>
<br>
Last I heard is that the ferry is back in bussines. The Chinese are also
 doing some major work on the RN1 between kikwit and Tshikapa. Quite a 
bit is tarred now. The road between Tshikapa and Kananga is notoriously 
muddy.<br>
Mbuji-Mayi to Lubumbashi wil be pretty much the unchanged since we were 
there. It's hard but doable (preferably outside the rainy season). Most 
of the terrain is sandy. If you do decide to go via Ilebo, do not forget
 to have 2 batteries handy to start the ferry.<br>
<br>
Ofcourse, always check the security situation, the best information can 
be had locally. Do not trust sources who are not actually in the 
country, they usually have no idea.<br>
<br>
More information coming up as soon as I have sorted the waypoints out.

</blockquote>Not "none", but it's close. The picture many people have of
 wildlife roaming everywhere is a picture drawn by documentaries in the 
wildparks of Eastern and Southern Africa. Most of Central (and western) 
Africa has very little wildlife left. I mean the traditional, 
spectacular wildlife (lions, elephant, ..). Congo is the only country in
 the world where one can still encounter Okapi's and is home to some of 
the last remaining Gorilla's. But the bulk of animals is gone. Eaten, 
poached, ... . And what remains stays well clear of humans.<br>

</blockquote>In that particular case I think we drove around it. Cut a 
way trough the bush. It really depends on the situation. Sometimes it is
 quicker and easier to just drive trough the bog. Sometimes it is easier
 to create a detour. Sometimes one takes the wrong decision too ;-)<br>

</blockquote>Thanks I guess ;-) I like to believe that too. Although I 
have the feeling I have only had a little glimpse of the world. It made 
me even more curious. It made me realize I do not understand most of 
what I have seen. It gave me many answers, but even more new questions. 
Often I am jealous about people who are content with their little world,
 often not bigger then their own town (I am talking about most people in
 the 'first world'), oblivious to what is happening in the rest of the 
world. It make life so much simpler! <br>

</blockquote>It crossed our mind briefly, but I did not really seriously
 consider it. Experiments like this take time and effort, so we only 
tried 'new things' when we believed it had a fair chance of succes. If 
it were just a straight hill, sure. But the tracks was often very narrow
 with little room for driving mistakes. And mistakes were always 
punished hard by getting stuck or tipping over.<br>

</blockquote>Nothing serious. The usual 'traveller problems' occured 
frequently and sometimes for long periods. A few cuts and bruises from 
time to time. We had an extensive medical kit with us, but we barely 
used anything from it. In general I would say we were much healthier 
while travelling then we were/are at home. The outdoor life and lack of 
stress I guess.<br>

Don't forget there is this live session next Sunday. We are curious to how that will work out!</div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">Sorry for the lack of updates the last few days, we've been terribly busy (planing trips :sombrero: ).<br>

Last night we had a test for the "Overland Live" session this Sunday. We
 will surely address some (most) of the questions asked here. Tickets 
are still available, but you need register in advance(free). Hope to see
 you then?<br>

(gps info,..) and one with a bit more info about equipment. It will not 
be for this week, but it's coming... soon(ish). <img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7" class="smilie smilie--sprite smilie--sprite1" alt=":)" title="Smile    :)" data-shortname=":)"></div><hr><div class="bbWrapper">I really ought to start a few new threads...

			I know you haven’t posted in some time but if you come back I do have a question. <br>
<br>
On page 82 when you show the evolution of your vehicle and is that an Azalai you have on the back of your Series 70?<br>
<br>
I ask because I am getting pretty close to giving up (within a couple 
years) the working life and doing my own around the world trip (my 
Gunther Holtorf impression). <br>
<br>
Finances is not really an issue in my life so I am thinking of going 
with a new Land Cruiser dual cab GXL and an Azalai Lababouch camper so 
was just looking for a quick opinion on that combo if you have one but 
don’t waste any time replying if it cuts into time spent posting the 
story of you and Josephine on your next adventure.
		</div>
		<div class="bbCodeBlock-expandLink"><a>Click to expand...</a></div>
	</div>
</blockquote>We have an Azalai now. Not the lababouch, but the dedicated
 one. I love it, provides a huge amount of comfort in a small package. 
For me this is about as big as I want my vehicle to be (for now, maybe 
one day you'll see mee driving in a huge truck... or on a bicycle..). I 
cannot really fault it up until now. Only problem for me is the legroom 
in the bed area, but this is specific to my model (they made changes in 
later models). I am planning to make some changes in the way the bed is 
organised to fix that.<br>
<br>
Great prospect you have. Enjoy every minute of it!<br>
