Want my help? I'm available for short-term remote work. What does "short-term remote work" mean, exactly? I'll review code, video chat, or even pair program with you (using [Floobits](https://floobits.com/), of course). Preferably, such jobs would only be a few hours.

For more info on my skills, see [my resume](/resume/) and [about me](/about/).

If you're interested in my services, please {% include contact.html %}.
