My name is Geoff Greer. I live in Vancouver, Washington. I like to mess with computers and motorcycles.

Works speak louder than words, so look at [my GitHub activity](https://github.com/ggreer) to get an idea of what I'm up to.

[Here's what hardware and software I use](/dev/).

<!-- If you'd like to take advantage of my expertise, I'm often available for [contract work](/hire/). -->
