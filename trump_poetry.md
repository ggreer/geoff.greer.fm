## Ode to Sean Hannity

I then spoke to Sean Hannity  
which everyone refuses to call Sean Hannity.  
I had numerous conversations with Sean Hannity  
at Fox.  
And Sean Hannity said,  
and he called me the other day.  
And I spoke to him about it.

## Computers

---

So we had to get very very tough  
on cyber  
and cyber warfare.  
It is a huge problem.  
I have a son --  
he’s ten years old.  
He has computers.  
He is so good with these computers.  
It’s unbelievable.

## My Company

I built an unbelievable company,  
some of the greatest assets  
anywhere in the world,  
real estate assets  
anywhere in the world,  
beyond the United States.  
In Europe,  
lots of different places.  
It's an unbelievable company.

She’s telling us how to fight ISIS.  
Just go to her website.  
She tells you how to fight ISIS  
on her website.

## Jobs

I’m really calling for  
major jobs  
because the wealthy are going to create  
tremendous jobs.  

They’re going to expand their companies.  
They’re going to do a  
tremendous job.

## Guns

we had to take the guns away  
from these people  
that have them and  
that are bad people  
that shouldn't have them.  
These are felons and  
these are people  
that are bad people  
that shouldn't be...

I just left Detroit and  
I just left Philadelphia and

and that's OK.
