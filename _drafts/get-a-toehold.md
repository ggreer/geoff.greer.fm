Sometimes I'll overhear a conversation and be completely baffled. This may be because the participants are using another language or jargon, or I wasn't paying attention at the start and now I've lost the train of thought. 

A useful metaphor for xxxxxxxxxxx is to get a toehold. When climbing, a toehold is the tiny thing that helps you move farther up. A toehold is that tiny bit of initial knowledge that you can use to learn the rest of the domain. It lets you bootstrap, so to speak.

You'd be surprised just how little you need to learn before you can start bootstrapping. Unfortunately, most people give up before they begin. They're scared by the initial incomprehensibility, or they're afraid they'll look foolish with so little knowledge. 

Yes, you will lose face if you say silly things in front of people who know more than you. That's the price of learning. If you're not willing to pay it, you'll remain ignorant.
