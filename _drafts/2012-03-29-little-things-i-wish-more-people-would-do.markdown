Here are some things I wish more people would do.

### Use the NATO phonetic alphabet

How often do you mis-hear B, D, and P? M and N are also commonly mixed up, especially over the phone. Militaries solved this problem half a century ago with a [standardized phonetic alphabet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NATO_phonetic_alphabet). 

### Use UTC for everything

Time zones suck. If you're coordinating with someone in another time zone, just use [UTC](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordinated_Universal_Time).
