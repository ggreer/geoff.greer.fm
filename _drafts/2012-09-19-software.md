I don't think coders have high enough expectations for software. 

Your hardware gets better every year. Why isn't the same true for software? 

Some of the most popular tools are decades old. VIM. Emacs. Bash. Computers were 10,000 times slower when these were created. 

With all our new knowledge of user interfaces, blah, and human-computer interaction, have we really been unable to build something better?
