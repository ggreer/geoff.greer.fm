irc etiquette

0. use google and search the docs before asking in IRC. regulars will get annoyed, since it shows you didn't try very hard to find the answer before wasting their time
1. don't ask to ask, just ask
2. pastebin the error logs and/or source code you have a problem with
3. say what you're trying to do. often there's an easier way to get what you want out of a language or framework
4. [don't be a dick](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick)
