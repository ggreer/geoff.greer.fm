I've found that planes provide a good opportunity for me to get stuff done. The isolation (lack of Internet access, phone, or friends nearby) helps me avoid distractions and forces my mind to stay focused on the job at hand. I'm also buoyed by the knowledge that I will have minimal interruptions for the duration of the flight.[1]

There are some caveats though.

I can't get just do any sort of work on a plane. Anything still requiring research is right-out. Learning a new programming language isn't going to happen. Writing something new in Twisted Python is fine, since I already know the language and I can save all the necessary documentation beforehand. Writing C is also fine, since most of its documentation is in manpages.

I don't travel with any sort of [shallow content](/2011/12/04/consume-less-shallow-content). Otherwise I'll waste time (and battery life) watching movies instead of coding. 

Battery life is a bit of a problem. My 11" Air lasts 2-6 hours depending on what I'm doing. That's good enough for most domestic flights, but the poor thing didn't stand a chance on my recent [Japan trip](/2012/03/16/japan-trip) . If my Air dies, I usually switch to my backup netbook.
