I'm not a big sports fan. Also, at the risk of alienating some readers, I will admit that I find American football to be an odious sport. Players suffer horrendous injuries for the sake of entertainment: joint trauma, concussions, traumatic brain injuries. The average NFL player lasts only 3.5 years.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> They are often left with permanent disabilities and limited means of providing for themselves. Life expectancy is

For these reasons (in addition to being rather tired from work), I didn't watch the Super Bowl. In doing so, I accidentally ran a bit of an experiment. I wasn't particularly curious who won the Super Bowl. I neither sought nor avoided the information. My browsing habits took me 34 hours to stumble on the answer. In that time, I visited over 850 web pages

I don't follow sports, but I also don't go around professing my ignorance. If someone changes the topic to sports, I still engage with them. I ask questions, and they're usually happy to answer. A couple days ago, someone delighted in telling me the story of Marshawn Lynch. (I had to look up the name, but I did remember his antics with the press.)
Having common ground with more people is not a bad argument for learning about sports. But I do have some qualms with the author's decision.
First, I cannot stress this enough: American football is an odious sport. Players regularly suffer concussions, traumatic brain injuries, and joint trauma. Permanent and debilitating injuries are common. The average player lasts 3.5 years in the NFL. Then they are spat out and left to deal with a lifetime of health issues. Yes, players freely choose their profession. So what? The same argument can be used to defend dueling. Football is bad and people should feel guilty watching it. If you're going to watch a popular sport, watch baseball.
But really, what's so bad about being out of touch with most Americans? Why draw the line at political borders? By population, vastly more people love cricket or soccer than American football. I don't mind being out of touch with sports enthusiasts regardless of their country of origin. If you're like me and you spend most of your time with people who aren't interested in sports, there's no point in learning about football or baseball. You already have common ground. Is that living in a bubble? Yes. I like living in a bubble. Economist Bryan Caplan explains the position better than I can.[1]
