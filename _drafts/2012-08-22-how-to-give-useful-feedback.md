A little over a month ago, Alex Davies sent me some great feedback about [The Silver Searcher](https://github.com/ggreer/the_silver_searcher). He suggested quite a few improvements, and linked to examples of these improvements in other projects. This sort of advice is great. I would have had to pay thousands of dollars to get the same information from a consultant. Since Ag is a personal project, I'd never do that sort of thing. Instead of charging for this service, Mr. Davies simply gave it to me for free. I hope this post serves to praise him and encourage others to behave similarly.



It's fine to point out problems, but remember that the author of the project has probably given lots of thought 

It's been said before, but I'll repeat it: Code is king. A patch or pull request is gold. I can't tell you how pleased I am when someone submits code to fix a problem. Even if the patch is all wrong, it's a starting point. Submitting patches is also a great way for a newbie to learn how to code.
