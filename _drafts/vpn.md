The Hidden Costs of a VPN

At work we have a VPN. This is common in large companies.

ticketing system on the vpn? fewer tickets created, more problems fester

expense reporting on the vpn? fewer expense reports, morale decreases

source repos on the vpn? less code written. harder to integrate with other services (buildbot, jenkins, etc). harder to deploy code

trivial inconveniences
