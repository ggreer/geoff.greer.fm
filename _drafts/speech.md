Lately, there has been a lot of debate over free speech, and I've noticed a surprising number of people misunderstand why absolute free speech is important. It's a common misconception that free speech is about the rights of the speaker. If you read the original texts that formulated the idea, you'll see it's about the rights of the audience; both those who agree and those who disagree.

The earliest example of this argument I can find is from almost 400 years ago. In [*Areopagitica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica), John Milton argued against restricting who could publish books in England.

In his 1794 introduction to [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason), Thomas Paine wrote:[^reason_intro]

> You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every Man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.

When Paine wrote this, he was a prisoner in Liechtenstein. Robespierre was considering executing him for his ideas. Still, Paine stuck to his principles.

80 years later, John Stuart Mill elaborated the same point in [*On Liberty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty):[^liberty]

> But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

> Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many.
