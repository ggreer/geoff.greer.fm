Lately I've encountered a lot of debate regarding freedom of speech, and I've noticed that many people misunderstand why freedom of speech is important. It's commonly assumed that free speech is about the right of the speaker to express their ideas. But if you go back and read the original formulations of the concept, you'll find a focus on the rights of the audience to hear.


### Paine

The most concise version of this argument comes from Thomas Paine's introduction to [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason)[^reason_intro]:

> You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every Man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.

Paine wrote this in 1794, while imprisoned in Liechtenstein. Robespierre was considering executing Paine for his ideas. Still, Paine stuck to his principles. He was lucky enough to be spared, and eventually returned to the US.


### Mill

80 years later, John Stuart Mill made the same argument in [*On Liberty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty):[^liberty]

> But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.

This is the most succinct and powerful argument for free speech that I have come across. It demonstrates why even the most detestable and wrong-headed ideas need to be allowed. Bad ideas are a fire in which good ideas are tempered.


### Who Decides?

Framing freedom of speech as freedom of hearing helps expose another problem with censorship: Who decides? If you ask, "Who should decide what ideas one may speak or publish?", many are willing to let a government body take the reins. If you ask, "Who should decide what ideas one may hear or read?", people recoil. But as Mill and others have pointed out, these are the same thing. If you're not willing to trust someone else to decide what you can to read or hear, then consistency dictates you not trust them to decide what can be written or uttered.


### Unintended Consequences

Lastly, there is the issue of unintended consequences from censoring certain ideas. Let's say our society passes laws banning the publishing of abhorrent and bigoted ideas like racism, sexism, homophobia, and antisemitism. So we ban *Mein Kampf*. No great loss, right? Can you think of some other influential texts that are full of racism, sexism, homophobia, and antisemitism? A couple come to my mind: The Bible. The Qur'an. These texts contain passages endorsing slavery. They dictate barbaric punishments such as amputating the limbs of thieves. For centuries, the ideas in these books have been justification for pogroms and massacres. Even today, they create needless suffering for much of humanity. How can you *not* ban them?


### Conclusion

These arguments aren't original, and they aren't new.

<!--
The earliest example of this argument I can find is from almost 400 years ago. In [*Areopagitica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica), John Milton argued against restricting who could publish books in England.

> Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many.



&mdash; both those who agree and those who disagree. In short: freedom of speech isn't about the right to speak, it's about the right to hear.
