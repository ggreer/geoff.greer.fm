There's been a lot of debate about free speech lately, and I've noticed that people on both sides often misunderstand why it's a good idea. It's commonly assumed that freedom of speech is about the right of the speaker to express their ideas, but if you read the original formulations of the concept, you'll find a totally different justification: Free speech is good because it benefits the audience, including those who disagree with the speaker. Freedom of speech isn't about speech. It's about hearing.


## Some History

A concise version of this argument comes from Thomas Paine's introduction to [*The Age of Reason*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Reason):

> You will do me the justice to remember, that I have always strenuously supported the Right of every Man to his own opinion, however different that opinion might be to mine. He who denies to another this right, makes a slave of himself to his present opinion, because he precludes himself the right of changing it.[^reason_intro]

Paine wrote this in 1794, while imprisoned in Liechtenstein. Robespierre was considering executing Paine for his ideas. He was lucky enough to be spared, and eventually returned to the US.

80 years later, John Stuart Mill made the same point in [*On Liberty*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/On_Liberty):

> But the peculiar evil of silencing the expression of an opinion is, that it is robbing the human race; posterity as well as the existing generation; those who dissent from the opinion, still more than those who hold it. If the opinion is right, they are deprived of the opportunity of exchanging error for truth: if wrong, they lose, what is almost as great a benefit, the clearer perception and livelier impression of truth, produced by its collision with error.[^liberty]

This is the most succinct and powerful argument for free speech that I have come across. It demonstrates why free speech must apply even to repulsive and wrong-headed ideas. We allow bad ideas because they help to strengthen good ideas. Hearing arguments for bad ideas allows us to find their flaws and discover better counterarguments. At the very least, debate forces us to re-examine why we believe what we believe. How do you know the earth is round? How do you know it's 4 billion years old and not 6,000? It's useful to occasionally rebuild one's beliefs from evidence and principles. Doing so helps us be wrong less often.

Alright. Let's say you largely agree with Paine and Mill, but feel that certain things simply aren't up for debate. Maybe some ideas are just too harmful or detestable to be tolerated in society. Even if that's true, the cure is likely worse than the disease. Banning ideas creates practical problems.


## Who Decides?

The key question of censorship is: Who decides what should be censored? Framing freedom of speech in terms of hearing reveals how insidious this question is. If you ask, "Who should decide which ideas one may speak or publish?", many are willing to let a government body take the reins. If you ask, "Who should decide which ideas you may hear or read?", people boggle. But as Paine and Mill pointed out, these are the same question. If you don't trust others to decide what you can read or hear, then you don't trust them to decide what can be written or uttered.


## Unintended Consequences

Imagine our society passes laws to ban the publishing of abhorrent and bigoted ideas. No longer are people allowed to express racism, sexism, homophobia, or antisemitism. So we ban *Mein Kampf*. No great loss there. Can you think of some other influential texts that are full of racism, sexism, homophobia, and antisemitism? A couple come to my mind: The Bible and the Qur'an. Honestly, how can you *not* ban them? These texts contain passages endorsing *slavery*. For centuries, the ideas in these books have been used to justify pogroms. Even today, they create needless suffering for much of humanity. If you find yourself struggling to find reasons why religious texts should be exempt, then you see the problem. If censorship laws are consistently applied, most religious texts will be banned. If they're inconsistently applied, the people in charge will censor according to their own beliefs and biases. Do you want the current administration to have that kind of authority? Neither outcome seems desirable.


## Conclusion

The arguments I outlined aren't new, but they seem to have disappeared from discourse. I hope that changes.

Freedom of speech is a crucial to the well-being of our society. That's *why* it's important. It's not some ideal to worship for its own sake. It's not because speakers should have a right to speak. No. It's a good idea because it leads to the best outcomes. That's why Mill, Paine, and others endorsed it. If they'd thought censoring some fringe ideas would make the world better-off, they would have said so. The originators of the free speech concept weren't dogmatic. They were pragmatic. It saddens me to see so many people misunderstand this.

The earliest example of this argument I can find is from almost 400 years ago. In [*Areopagitica*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Areopagitica), John Milton argued against restricting who could publish books in England.

> Let us suppose, therefore, that the government is entirely at one with the people, and never thinks of exerting any power of coercion unless in agreement with what it conceives to be their voice. But I deny the right of the people to exercise such coercion, either by themselves or by their government. The power itself is illegitimate. The best government has no more title to it than the worst. It is as noxious, or more noxious, when exerted in accordance with public opinion, than when in opposition to it. If all mankind minus one, were of one opinion, and only one person were of the contrary opinion, mankind would be no more justified in silencing that one person, than he, if he had the power, would be justified in silencing mankind. Were an opinion a personal possession of no value except to the owner; if to be obstructed in the enjoyment of it were simply a private injury, it would make some difference whether the injury was inflicted only on a few persons or on many.
