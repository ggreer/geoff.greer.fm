I recently read [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/)'s book, [*Age of Em: Work, Love and Life when Robots Rule the Earth*](http://ageofem.com/). I found it quite interesting. It's given me a lot to think about.




As positive as my review is, I can't recommend *Age of Em* to everyone. It will only interest a small segment of people.



I don't know enough social science to tell whether Hanson is using these theories correctly.

Way more books like this need to be written. Too much futurism is pure fantasy

Language is dry. Not a bad as an academic paper, but not particularly completing. This could be taken on a positive light. It means the book stands up on the basis of its ideas alone, not just fancy writing

Lots of detractors say "what if you can change ems?" but I'm most cases, these don't affect the outcome much

If leader copies are cheap, could you do a groundhog day attack on a leader? Might need mitigation 

Section on lone developers is fascinating. 

How do holidays work? 

Lends itself well to being an eBook
Lots of references and links to other chapters

Did Robin Hanson write this knowing about peak end effect?

Doesn't talk about gene boosting. Of that happens before ems then only gene boosted humans will become ems 

Criticisms

Very few.
Most of it is written very matter of factly. Once might even say that the language is dry. Becomes more passionate in conclusion. Good use of the peak end effect.

Em world doesn't sound so bad when you examine it closely. They will be smarter and harder working than almost anyone today. They'll be happy and healthy and live long fulfilling lives.

Most importantly they'll be much better at solving AI risk. This book convinced me that the best path to reducing existential risk is to create ems.
