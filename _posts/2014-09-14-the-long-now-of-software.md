What sort of software can be built today that would be useful a century from now? Give it 60 seconds of thought before reading on. I'll wait.

No matter what happens, I seriously doubt that any binary executable compiled today will run on a computer a century hence. There are simply too many ways in which computers will change. New CPU architectures and operating systems will arise. Protocols and encoding formats will change. New ways of interacting with computers will be invented.

At its core, this is an exercise in predicting what *won't* change. Which file formats used today today will still be popular in 2114? Which of today's programming languages will still have compilers?

Any software used in 2114 must work with file formats so basic that even we would use them today. There is only one credible format that fits the bill: Text files. The encoding format may change a little, but it will likely be a superset of ASCII (like UTF-8). Still, changing encoding

Also, such software must be written in a language that is still supported in 2114. In other words: C.

It's a pretty safe bet that, if humans are still around and using computers in 2114, they'll use text files and they'll have C compilers. Will they also have JavaScript? Maybe, but I wouldn't rely on it to be fully backwards compatible.
