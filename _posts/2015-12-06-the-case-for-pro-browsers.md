Browsers were originally for devs and other pros.

But have slowly become more geared toward consumers.

This is a good thing.

Examples of consumer-ization of browsers:

https://code.google.com/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=345205#c21

Annoying things devs have to deal with:

node.js hsts header break localhost


Solution: Differentiate!

Need a new browser targeting professionals.
