title: Dear Recruiters, You Have a Hiring Blind Spot
categories:
---

I'm often contacted by recruiters. I feel bad not replying to them. Worse, I know they'll continue their behavior if I don't correct it. Unfortunately, I can't take the time to reply to each one individually. It would waste too much of my time. I wrote this post so I could link to it when recruiters contact me. If you are not a recruiter, you may still wish to read it. If you think this accurately reflects your own views, feel free to link to it.

Dear Recruiter,

Please don't take this personally. I simply don't have time to tailor my reply to everyone who contacts me.

I realize you're just doing your job. I realize that you are probably a nice person. If we knew each other in real life, I don't doubt we'd be friendly toward one another. We'd probably enjoy having a few drinks together, and I bet we could learn a lot from each other.

But I'm sorry to say that you are wasting your own time as well as mine, because you have no chance of recruiting me.

Right now I am doing the thing I most want to do. I'm building the thing that I've always wanted to build. I'm the CEO and co-founder of a [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/) company. There's no chance that I'm going to give this up.

Even if I wasn't doing that; even if my job was miserable, I would be very desperate before I talked to recruiters. Every single job I've had since college, I've gotten through my friends. 


I know you help people. Many have found fulfilling, enjoyable positions through recruiters. You're 

If you value me as a human being, please don't contact me.


Sincerely,

Hopefully, this post doesn't come off as boastful. I realize I'm lucky to have the combination of social connections and skill that allows me to be picky about my employment. Instead of computers, I could have just as easily been interested in anthropology. How different my life would be.
