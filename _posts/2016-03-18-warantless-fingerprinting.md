Imagine we lived in a world where the police needed a warrant to dust for fingerprints. That is, after a crime is reported, the police have to go to a judge and demonstrate probable cause before they can dust for fingerprints.

 what fingerprints were at the scene. 

It would be a world much like this one, except criminals would get away with crimes more often. 

Now imagine what would happen if you said that the country would be better-off if police *didn't* need a warrant to dust for fingerprint. criminals would be caught sooner

In other words, you're a fan of warrantless fingerprinting. You would likely be branded as a fascist by groups like the [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) and [EFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation). 

Even though your words are sincere and your reasoning is straightforward, people continually misrepresent you as an authoritarian who hates privacy.

Does this sound familiar to you? It should.


without fingerprint evidince, prosecutors rely on flimsier eyewitness testimony, and get the wrong person more often
