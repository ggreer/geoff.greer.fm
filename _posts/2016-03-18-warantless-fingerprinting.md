Imagine we lived in a world where the police needed a warrant to dust for fingerprints. That is, after a crime is reported, the police have to go to a judge and demonstrate probable cause before they can dust the crime scene for fingerprints. It would be a world much like this one, except criminals would get away with crimes more often.

Now imagine you said that the country would be better-off if police *didn't* need a warrant to dust for fingerprints. Yes, you admit, there's a chance that warrantless fingerprinting could infringe on the privacy of innocent people, but more criminals would be caught. Also, without fingerprints, prosecutors often rely on flimsier evidence such as eyewitness testimony. In addition to fewer convictions, this leads to the *wrong* convictions. Warrantless fingerprinting could reduce crime, save lives, and make justice more just.

Now imagine the likely reactions to these statements. You are, in short, a fan of warrantless fingerprinting. If you had any fame at all, you would likely be branded as a fascist by groups like the [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) and the [EFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation). If you were just a normal person, many of your friends and peers would think less of you. Despite being sincere in your views and using straightforward reasoning, people would continually misrepresent you as an authoritarian who hates privacy.

Hopefully by now, you've realized this post isn't about warrantless fingerprinting. Our current legal system is the result of many accidents of history. In some circumstances, it may give too much leeway to police and prosecutors. In others, it may give too little. Reasonable, intelligent people can come to different conclusions about this. Many of those in favor of warrantless X are not authoritarian or fascistic.
