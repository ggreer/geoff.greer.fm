Imagine we lived in a world where the police needed a warrant to dust for fingerprints. That is, after a crime is reported, the police have to go to a judge and demonstrate probable cause before they can dust the crime scene for fingerprints. It would be a world much like this one, except criminals would get away with crimes more often.

Now imagine you said that the country would be better-off if police *didn't* need a warrant to dust for fingerprints. Yes, you admit, there's a chance that warrantless fingerprinting could infringe on the privacy of innocent people, but more criminals would be caught. Also, without fingerprints, prosecutors often rely on flimsier evidence such as eyewitness testimony. In addition to fewer convictions, this leads to the *wrong* convictions. Warrantless fingerprinting could reduce crime, save lives, and make justice more just.

Now imagine the likely reaction to these statements. You are, in short, a fan of warrantless fingerprinting. If you had any fame at all, you would likely be branded as a fascist by groups like the [ACLU](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Civil_Liberties_Union) and [EFF](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electronic_Frontier_Foundation). If you were just a normal person, many of your friends and peers would think less of you.

Even though your words are sincere and your reasoning is straightforward, people continually misrepresent you as an authoritarian who hates privacy.

Does this sound familiar to you? It should.
