I rewrote my site in [Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll) this weekend. Apologies for the extra items in the RSS feed. Unfortunately I misconfigured the site URL, which changed every post ID, which made RSS readers think I had a bunch of new posts.

I'm still going back through old posts to fix formatting errors. Also, comments will come back at some point in the future.

I hope you like the new design. It's a blatant rip-off of [mnmlist](http://mnmlist.com/).

Edit: Everyone's comments are back.
