In *Age of Em*, Robin Hanson briefly discusses software rot:

> As software that was designed to match one set of tasks, tools, and situations is slowly changed to deal with a steady stream of new tasks, tools, and situations, such software becomes more complex, fragile, and more difficult to usefully change (Lehman and Belady 1985)[^Lehman]. Eventually it is better to start over and write whole new subsystems, and sometimes whole new systems, from scratch.

I'm pretty sure this is true. Adapting mature software to new circumstances tends to take more time and effort than writing new software from scratch. Software people don't like to admit this, but open source software has several high-profile examples.


## Multi-process Firefox

When it was first written, [Mozilla Firefox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Firefox) ran everything in a single process. After the release of [Google Chrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Chrome), it was clear than a multi-process model allowed for better security and performance. Mozilla developers quickly began to sketch-out a path to making Firefox multi-process. That was in 2007.

Almost a decade later, Firefox is just now becoming multi-process. This delay isn't from lack of trying. The teams at Mozilla are talented and driven. Still, Chrome was written from scratch in less time than it's taken for Firefox to change. There are several reasons for this:

- Making single process architecture multi-process means changing a *lot* of small things. Certain function calls have to be replaced with inter-process communication. State can't be stored in shared variables. Caches and local databases must handle concurrent access.
- Firefox needed to be compatible with existing add-ons (or make devs update their add-ons). Chrome could create an extention API from scratch.


## Event-driven Apache

When Apache httpd was first written, it used a process-per-connection model. One process would listen on port 80, then `accept()` and `fork()`. The child process would then `read()` and `write()`, finally closing and exiting when it was done. This architecture has the advantage of being simple, easy to implement across platforms, andâ€¦ not much else. It's absolutely terrible for performance, especially when handling long-lived connections. To be fair, this *was* 1995.

Apache eventually moved to a threaded model, which did help performance. Still, it couldn't handle [10,000 simultaneous connections](c10k problem).

In contrast, [Nginx]() was engineered with an event loop architecture. This allowed it to service many more concurrent connections. The advantage was


(link to forking conn handler model)

Connection per process (fork)
Connection per thread ()
Event-driven (can support many more connections, immune to slowloris-style attacks)


httpd (multi-process, multi-thread) vs nginx (event-driven)



## CPython GIL

Python is slow.


## Conclusion

Even with talented engineers, plenty of money, and clear vision, changing mature software can be near-impossible. I tried to find cases that disproved software rot, but they don't seem to exist.
