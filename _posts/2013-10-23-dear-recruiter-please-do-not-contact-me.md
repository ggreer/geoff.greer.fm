title: Dear Recruiter, Please Do Not Contact Me
categories:
---

I'm often contacted by recruiters. I feel bad not replying to them. Worse, I know they'll continue their behavior if I don't correct it. Unfortunately, I can't take the time to reply to each one individually. It would take up too much of my time. I wrote this post so that I could link to it when recruiters contact me. If you think this accurately reflects your own views, feel free to do the same. If you are not a recruiter, you may still wish to read it.

Dear Recruiter,

Please don't take this personally. I simply don't have time to tailor my reply to everyone who contacts me.

I realize you're just doing your job. I realize that you are probably a nice person. If we knew each other in real life, I don't doubt we'd be friendly toward one another. We'd probably enjoy having a few drinks together, and I bet we could learn a lot from each other.

But I'm sorry to say that you are wasting your own time as well as mine, because you have no chance of recruiting me.

Right now I am doing what I most want to do. I'm building the thing that I've always wanted to build. There's no chance that I'm going to give this up.

Even if I wasn't doing that; even if my job was miserable, I would avoid recruiters. There's one simple reason for this: friends. Every single job I've had, I've gotten through my friends. Almost every interview I've done, I've gotten through my friends. They know what I want, what I dislike, and they put my interests first. The same cannot be said for recruiters.

That said, I know you help people. Many have found fulfilling, enjoyable positions through recruiters. You're providing a valuable service.

But if you value me as a human being, please don't contact me about a job. I'm one of the extremely fortunate who have no need for your service.


Sincerely,

Hopefully, this post doesn't come off as boastful. I realize I'm lucky to have the combination of social connections and skill that allows me to be picky about employment. Instead of computers, I could have just as easily been interested in anthropology. How different my life would be.

For one thing, my handwriting would be better.
