I was close to my earned-time-off cap, so I took the month of March off. The first half of the month was a trip to Japan with [Paul](http://journal.paul.querna.org/), [Shawn](), [Brad](), and Caity (Brad's wife). It was quite enjoyable. We managed to have a pretty good balance of calm time and party time. I also paid down some of my [sleep debt]().

Photos are [here](/photos/japan_trip).

My favorite part of the entire trip was going to the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. We drank expensive cocktails while admiring [the Blade Runner-esque view](link to a sweet picture here). A close second was running in the hills above Kyoto as snow fell.

I'm back in San Francisco for the weekend (and my birthday, also known as St. Patrick's Day), then it's off to Chile and Argentina until the end of the month.
