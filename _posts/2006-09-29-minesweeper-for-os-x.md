Some guy on [The Awful Forums](http://forums.somethingawful.com/) made a JavaScript clone of Windows Minesweeper a while back. It didn't detect right-clicks properly and had some bugs in Safari, but I fixed it and made it into a widget (yet another instance of me standing on some else's shoulders). Anyway anyone who wants it can click [here](/code/widgets/minesweeper.wdgt.zip).

Since the original Windows graphics are used, there's probably some copyright infringement going on. Oh well, [this](/gallery/d/130-1/minesweeper.png) screenshot makes it worth it.
