At the start of the week [one of my coworkers](http://journal.paul.querna.org/) got an iPhone and started tinkering with [iUI](http://www.joehewitt.com/iui/). It didn't take long for an iPhone version of [Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/) to come about. Over the next few days the team polished it up and deployed it. You can try iBloglines out [here](http://i.bloglines.com/). It should work alright in Firefox and Safari, but it really shines on the iPhone. I'd say it's better than the current [mobile Bloglines](http://www.bloglines.com/mobile), but of course iSafari can do XMLHttpRequests. Not bad for rapid application development in C++.
  

  

The following screenshots were taken in iPhoney, so they don't get rid of the tool bar like on the iPhone:
