Last Saturday I bought a 1997 Mazda Miata. Since I moved to a warmer climate I've wanted a convertible of some kind. My requirements were:



	
  1. Convertible, duh.

	
  2. Target price of $5,000. This means used, but I wanted to pay cash instead of financing. More expensive cars also cost more to insure.

	
  3. The car must be reliable enough to be a daily driver.

	
  4. It has to be fun to drive.


Requirement #2 ruled out similar cars such as the S2000 and newer versions of the MR2. Consumer Reports rated the Miata more reliable than the MR2 or pretty much any other sporty car, so I settled on the Miata. Although it's not a very powerful car (only 140hp), it more than makes up for it with its light weight, short gears, and excellent handling. My only complaint is the cost of insurance. I know 22-year-old males aren't the safest drivers, but $3,000 a year is pretty ridiculous.

Here's a picture:

Some of my [coworkers mocked me](http://kelnishi.com/blog/20071010/news/geoff-got-a-miata/) for having a car with such effeminate looks. They're all jealous since they own practical cars with features such as four doors, rear seats, and a trunk you can actually fit a body in.
