Back in January, I [used an old Thinkpad]({% post_url 2017-01-23-oldest-viable-laptop %}) while my [12" Macbook]({% post_url 2015-04-19-2015-macbook-review %}) was being repaired. I found myself really enjoying some aspects of it.

Some features were "nice to have", but not particularly compelling: the size was nice, albeit thick. The removable battery came in handy a few times.

Some aspects were embarassingly poor. The screen resolution was only 1024×768, and not IPS. The VGA-out restricted possibilities for external displays. Performance and battery life were… less than ideal. Even a maxxed-out machine (1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, 8GB of RAM, SATAII SSD) was a little sluggish for work. middleton bios to get sata2

A couple of features were things I didn't know I was missing. The keyboard was amazing. It's a scandal that laptop keyboards have gotten *worse*.

Another thing I didn't know I missed was the screen; specifically, the aspect ratio. The 4:3 aspect ratio was perfect. The screen was dim, but I fixed that with an [LED backlight conversion kit](https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/thinkpad/led-backlight.shtml).

Still, I ended up using it more than my 12" MacBook. The X61 convinced me that a much better laptop could exist. The same chassis with modern components would be a formidable competitor in the high-end laptop market.

### The X62

In my quest for something better, I stumbled upon the X62. This "model" (really more of an upgrade) isn't made by Lenovo. It's the product of some enthusiasts in Shenzhen. The X62 is an X61 chassis but with:

- A 12" 1400×1050 IPS LCD salvaged from an X60 tablet.
- An Intel Core i7-5600U (Broadwell. Dual core. Turbo boost up to 3.2GHz.)
- Up to 32GB of RAM.
- Mini DisplayPort & mini-HDMI out.
- 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4, USB 3, SD card reader, gigabit ethernet

I ordered one back in March and received it in June. Linux required some tweaking to enable lower power states, but now it's a joy to use.


### Fixing Linux

Ubuntu 17.04 worked out of the box, but there was one annoyance: battery life. For some reason, the laptop was using 14 watts at idle. Thanks to some forum posts, I managed to tweak various module options and got idle down to 5 watts. This drastically improved battery life
