Back in January, I [used an old Thinkpad]({% post_url 2017-01-23-oldest-viable-laptop %}) while my [12" Macbook]({% post_url 2015-04-19-2015-macbook-review %}) was being repaired. I found myself really enjoying some aspects of it.

Some features were "nice to have", but not particularly compelling: I liked the form factor, though it was a bit thick. The removable battery came in handy a few times. I enjoyed little details like the latching lid and small bezels.

Some aspects were embarassingly poor. The screen resolution was only 1024×768, and not [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel). The VGA-out restricted possibilities for external displays. Performance and battery life were… less than ideal. Even a maxxed-out machine (1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, 8GB of RAM, SATAII SSD) was a little sluggish for work. middleton bios to get sata2

A couple of features were things I didn't know I was missing. The keyboard was amazing. It's a scandal that laptop keyboards have gotten *worse*.

Another thing I didn't know I missed was the screen; specifically, the aspect ratio. The 4:3 aspect ratio was perfect. The screen was dim, but I fixed that with an [LED backlight conversion kit](https://people.xiph.org/~xiphmont/thinkpad/led-backlight.shtml).

Still, I ended up using it more than my 12" MacBook. The X61 convinced me that a much better laptop could exist. The same chassis with modern components would be a very compelling product.


### The X62

TODO: fix link to 51nb

In the quest for something better, I stumbled upon the X62. This "model" (really more of an upgrade) isn't made by Lenovo. It's the product of [51nb](51nb.com), a group of ThinkPad enthusiasts in Shenzhen. The X62 is an X61 chassis but with:

- A 12" 1400×1050 IPS LCD (likely salvaged from an X60 tablet).
- An Intel Core i7-5600U (Broadwell. Dual core. Turbo boost up to 3.2GHz.)
- Up to 32GB of RAM.
- Mini DisplayPort & mini-HDMI out.
- 802.11ac, Bluetooth 4, USB 3, SD card reader, gigabit ethernet

I ordered one back in March and received it in June.


### Linux

Ubuntu 17.04 worked out of the box, but there was one annoyance: battery life. For some reason, the laptop was using 14 watts at idle. Thanks to some forum posts, I managed to tweak various kernel module options and got idle down to 5 watts. This drastically improved battery life. The specific tweaks were:

TODO: add actual commands and config changes here

- enable sata power saving in BIOS
- use uefi (disable compatibility in BIOS)
- enable wifi power saving
- enable usb sleep
- 

rc.local to enable power savings on startup (go down rabbit hole with systemd to get rc.local behavior again)
on startup & resume idles in PC6

I wish Linux had better defaults, but this sort of thing is to be expected when it comes to open source software. Still, after these tweaks, the X62 has become a joy to use.


## Conclusion

The X62 is a niche product, but for me it's the best option out there. My MacBook has become my secondary laptop. I've only taken it out of the house once since I got the X62, and that was for my Oregon bikepacking trip.
