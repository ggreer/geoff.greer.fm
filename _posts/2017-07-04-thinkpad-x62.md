Back in January, I [used an old Thinkpad]({% post_url 2017-01-23-oldest-viable-laptop %}) while my [12" Macbook]({% post_url 2015-04-19-2015-macbook-review %}) was being repaired. I found myself really enjoying some aspects of it.

First, the keyboard was amazing. 
size was nice
swappable battery pretty sweet
4:3 aspect ratio was perfect

screen was dim. fixed with LED backlight kit
screen not IPS & resolution only 1024x768. looked ugly
vga out :(
battery life could be better considering performance
performance sucked
even a maxxed-out machine (1.8GHz Core 2 Duo, 8GB of RAM, SATAII SSD) was a little sluggish for work
middleton bios to get sata2
still, I ended up using it more than my 12" MacBook

quest for something better
