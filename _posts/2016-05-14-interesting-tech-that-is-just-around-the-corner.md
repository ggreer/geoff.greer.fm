There are some interesting technologies that will probably exist in the next 5-10 years, but that few people seem to be paying attention to. The hype is around bigger, self-driving cars and CRISPR.


### VR with Eye Tracking

VR is becoming commercially feasible, but few have paid attention to how it can be improved with [eye-tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking). It may seem like a minor addition, but eye-tracking allows for far more interesting experiences.

Imagine this technology being used the next [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill) or [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil). 

It would be –without a doubt– the scariest game *ever*.


### Paralympics

paralympic records beat olympics (or olypmics allow paralympic athletes to compete)

There was some talk of this in 2012, when Oscar Pistorious competed in the 400m. 


### Implantable Blood Glucose Monitors


### Conclusion

These new technologies won't fundamentally change the human condition.
