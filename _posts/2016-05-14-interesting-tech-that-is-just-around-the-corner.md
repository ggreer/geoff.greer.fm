When talking about near-future technologies, much hype surrounds stuff like self-driving cars and [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR). But few people are paying attention to things that are both closer to fruition and more likely to be brought to market.


## VR with Eye Tracking

VR is becoming commercially feasible, but few have paid attention to how it can be improved with [eye-tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking). It may seem like a minor addition, but it's not just a joystick-like input. Eye-tracking allows for far more interesting VR experiences.

Imagine this technology being used in a VR [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill) or [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil). You put the headset on and start playing. You see something move in your peripheral vision, but by the time your eyes have [saccaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade), it's gone. No matter how hard you try, you can't get a good look at it. With only hints and sounds to go on, your imagination fills in the rest.

Such a game would be –without a doubt– the scariest game *ever*. I can't wait to play it.


## Paralympics

It's likely that some Paralympic records will soon exceed their Olympic counterparts. At top speed, the best below-the-knee prosthetics are more efficient than natural legs.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> So why haven't the records already fallen? Several reasons:

- Compared to able-bodied athletes, the talent pool of below-the-knee amputee athletes is miniscule. Oscar Pistorius was in the top 0.1% of that group. In comparison, Usain Bolt is in the top 0.000001% of able-bodied athletes.
- Runners on prosthetics take longer to accelerate to top speed, hurting their performance in shorter distance events. Unfortunately, the longest Paralympic event for below-the-knee amputees is 400m.

So the technology is here, but it's hard to predict exactly when a Paralympic athlete will hold an overall record. It all depends on the talent pool and the whims of the International Paralympic Committee. I'd put even money on it happening before or at Tokyo (2020).


## Implantable Blood Glucose Monitors

1 in 12 adults worldwide have diabetes.<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup> Sufferers can lose limbs or even go blind. With proper blood glucose monitoring, many of these maladies can be avoided. Today, this requires pricking the skin to get a blood sample. 


## Conclusion

These new technologies won't fundamentally change the human condition. Unless it's an uneventful day, I doubt they'll even make the news. But they are a few of the many ways in which people are improving the human condition.
