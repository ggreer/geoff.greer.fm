When talking about near-future technologies, much hype surrounds stuff like self-driving cars and [CRISPR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRISPR). But few people are paying attention to things that are both closer to fruition and more likely to be brought to market.


## VR with Eye Tracking

VR is becoming commercially feasible, but few have paid attention to how it can be improved with [eye-tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking). It may seem like a minor addition, but it's not just a joystick-like input. Eye-tracking allows for far more interesting VR experiences.

Imagine this technology being used in a VR [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill) or [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil). You put the headset on and start playing. You see something move in your peripheral vision, but by the time your eyes have [saccaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade), it's gone. No matter how hard you try, you can't get a good look at it. With only hints and sounds to go on, your imagination fills in the rest.

Such a game would be â€“without a doubtâ€“ the scariest game *ever*. I can't wait to play it. ðŸ˜€


## Paralympics

It's likely that some Paralympic records will soon exceed their Olympic counterparts. At top speed, the best below-the-knee prosthetics are more efficient than natural legs.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> So why haven't the records already fallen? Several reasons:

- The talent pool of below-the-knee amputee athletes is miniscule. Oscar Pistorius was in the top 0.1% of that group. In comparison, Usain Bolt is in the top 0.000001% of his group.
- Runners on prosthetics take longer to accelerate to top speed, hurting their performance in shorter distance events. Unfortunately, the longest paralympic event for below-the-knee amputees is 400m.


## Implantable Blood Glucose Monitors

1 in 12 adults worldwide have diabetes.<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup> Sufferers can lose limbs or even go blind. 


## Conclusion

These new technologies won't fundamentally change the human condition. Unless it's an uneventful day, I doubt they'll even make the news.
