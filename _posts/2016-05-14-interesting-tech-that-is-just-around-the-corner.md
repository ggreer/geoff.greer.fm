When talking about near-future technologies, much hype surrounds stuff like self-driving cars and CRISPR. There are some other interesting things that will probably exist in the next 5-10 years, but that few people seem to be paying attention to.


## VR with Eye Tracking

VR is becoming commercially feasible, but few have paid attention to how it can be improved with [eye-tracking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eye_tracking). It may seem like a minor addition, but eye-tracking allows for far more interesting experiences. It's not just an extra input like a joystick.

Imagine this technology being used in a VR [Silent Hill](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silent_Hill) or [Resident Evil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resident_Evil). You put the headset on and start playing. You see something move in your peripheral vision, but by the time your eyes have [saccaded](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saccade), it's gone.

Such a game would be â€“without a doubtâ€“ the scariest game *ever*. I can't wait to play it. ðŸ˜€


## Paralympics

paralympic records beat olympics (or olypmics allow paralympic athletes to compete)

There was some talk of this in 2012, when Oscar Pistorious competed in the 400m. 


## Implantable Blood Glucose Monitors


## Conclusion

These new technologies won't fundamentally change the human condition.
