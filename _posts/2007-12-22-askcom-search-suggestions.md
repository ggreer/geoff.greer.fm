I've noticed the search suggestions on Ask.com are a little... preoccupied with a certain topic:
![How to](http://geoff.greer.fm/rambling/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-3.png)
![How do I know](http://geoff.greer.fm/rambling/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-5.png)
![si](http://geoff.greer.fm/rambling/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-6.png)
![e](http://geoff.greer.fm/rambling/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-2.png)
![v](http://geoff.greer.fm/rambling/wp-content/uploads/2007/12/picture-1.png)

I know medical searches are increasing, but this is a little ridiculous.
