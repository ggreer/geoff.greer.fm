I've noticed the search suggestions on Ask.com are a little... preoccupied with a certain topic:

![How to](/images/search_suggestions/picture-3.png)

![How do I know](/images/search_suggestions/picture-5.png)

![si](/images/search_suggestions/picture-6.png)

![e](/images/search_suggestions/picture-2.png)

![v](/images/search_suggestions/picture-1.png)

I know medical searches are increasing, but this is a little ridiculous.
