My grandmother died last month. It's sad, but not unexpected. Last summer, both of us happened to be visiting my parents in Spokane. One day, she was short of breath. I took her to the hospital, where after hours of tests and waiting, the doctor said her lungs were in horrible shape. The cause was most likely a form of rheumatoid arthritis.

Over the next six months, she slowly suffocated as her lungs turned into scar tissue. 

The funeral was sad, but not unpleasant.

One thing I really enjoyed was going through grandma's stuff.

It would have been nice to have seen her one last time.
