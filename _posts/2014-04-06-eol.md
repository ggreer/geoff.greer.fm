My grandmother died last month. It's sad, but not unexpected. Last summer, both of us visited my parents in Spokane. One day she was short of breath, so I took her to the hospital. After hours of tests and waiting, the doctor said her lungs were in horrible shape. The cause was most likely a form of rheumatoid arthritis. There was nothing they could do to restore the lost lung function. She'd have to be on oxygen for the rest of her life. I knew, right then, that she was going to die from this. I'm pretty sure everyone did, but nobody wanted to say it out loud.

I tried to spend more time with her while we were both in Spokane.

Over the next six months, grandma slowly suffocated as her lungs turned into scar tissue.

The funeral was sad, but not unpleasant.

One thing I really enjoyed was going through grandma's stuff.

It would have been nice to have seen her one last time.
