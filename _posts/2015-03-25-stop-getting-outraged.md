Over the past few years, I've noticed a certain behavior pattern in an increasing number of my peers. First, they read a blog post describing something egregious happening to someone. Then, they proceed to voice their outrage to as many people as possible. They tweet about it. They talk about it on IRC. They submit it to aggregators like Reddit and Hacker News. They write comments calling the perpetrator of this injustice a monster who deserves to have their life ruined. They condemn anyone who raises objections, calls for restraint, or doubts the story. A week later, the whole thing is forgotten. By then, they've moved on to some other injustice-du-jour.

This behavior is absurd. It might just be the most reliable way to make oneself unhappy while accomplishing nothing.

If I got angry at every stupid opinion I saw online, I'd be a very a unpleasant person to be around.

Getting angry at whatever dumb
