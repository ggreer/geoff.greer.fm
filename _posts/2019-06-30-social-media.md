> I just re-read the Unabomer's manifesto. … It is a slightly crazy document… but the truth is that it is better reasoned and modulated than half of what I see on Twitter. And this is from people with blue check marks by their names and large followings.

> I don't know what it means to be able to honestly say that half the people on Twitter seem less hinged than a man who was sending bombs in the mail, but it does seem that we're performing an experiment on ourselves&mdash; the consequences of which are as yet undetermined. Anyway I'm very happy to have withdrawn to the degree I have. It feels far more sane.

Social media definitely has potential, but I haven't found it to be useful or interesting in a long time. I've drifted away from using Facebook, Twitter, and Reddit. When I occasionally revisit them, I am astounded by how insane many of the comments seem.

On the bright side, I'm reading more books.
