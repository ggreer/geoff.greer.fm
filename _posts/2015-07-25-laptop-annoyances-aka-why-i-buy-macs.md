title: Laptop Annoyances (AKA why I use a MacBook)
categories:
  - Computers

When asked why I use macs, I reply with something along the lines of, "Because macs don't annoy me as much as other laptops." That response is immediately followed up with a request for examples. If this conversation is face-to-face, I boggle for a moment. There are so *many* examples that I have trouble enumerating them. To prevent this from happening in the future, I've taken the time to list and explain these common annoyances.

In the infintesimal chance that a Lenovo exec reads this: Please consider it a list of things to verify before shipping your products.

### Battery life

I think most people need at least 9 hours of battery life in typical usage. Software developers probably need 12. This may sound like a lot, but let me explain.

Nobody has ever said, "I wish this laptop's battery didn't last so long." Still, an astonishing fraction of laptops have terrible battery life. Below some threshold, battery logistics are a constant distraction. Carry a charger. Search for a seat near an outlet. Dim your screen. Close apps. Monitor battery percentage like it's the blood pressure of a cardiac patient.

Longer battery life is liberating. Once it reaches a certain threshold, you can just plug in at night and stop worrying. After experiencing this, it's impossible to go back.

Take a look at this UltraBook™®© next to my MacBook. It's ultra-huge. Sure, I *could* carry it around, but I don't *want* to. At the margins, bigger laptops will be left at home more often.

To borrow a photography phrase: the best laptop is the one you have with you. That's why I get tiny laptops and take them *everywhere*. Except when using netbooks, I've never thought, "This laptop is too small." And I've never thought, "This laptop is too light."

### Screen



The screen is the part of the laptop that users spend all their time staring at. A low-quality screen will constantly remind the owner of their poor purchase. A quality laptop will have a high-resolution [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel) screen. Apple calls these Retina displays.

Once you use such screens, you can't go back. Everything else looks blurry, blocky, and washed-out. Until the 12" MacBook came out, I deliberately avoided looking at

### Keyboard

So many laptops get this wrong. Do not alter the layout! Don't try to be fancy with "smart" function keys.

The keyboard is the part of the laptop users will interact with the most. Though opinions about keyboard "feel" are highly subjective, certain properties are disliked by everyone. Anything that's "squishy" or "wobbly" is a no-no.

### Suspend/Hibernate

Here is how suspend and hibernate should work:

- When the lid closes, the laptop suspends to RAM. It consumes <1% battery per hour in this mode.

- When the lid *starts to open*, the laptop resumes. The screen is on and ready to go before the user can finish opening the lid.

- If the laptop is open but sleeping (often due to idle), hitting any key or clicking the trackpad will resume it. The screen must be on and ready to work within a second.

### Fans

Except for the most advanced low-power hardware, laptop fans are a still necessity.

<span id="drivers"></span>
### Drivers

Even the best hardware can be ruined by bad drivers.

Bluetooth, WiFi, camera, mic, trackpad, power saving, screen brightness, 

This stuff isn't rocket science. No new technology needs to be invented. It's purely attention to detail.

### Other minor gripes

- LEDs. The only thing worse than an always-on LED is a constantly blinking LED. Double points if it's one of those insanely bright blue LEDs. You might as well have a laptop that comes with an automatic eye-poking machine.

- Camera. The camera must be centered above the screen. Any other position will make for some weird camera angles. Occasionally, I'll see a model with the camera near the hinge. That's great if you want to look up someone's nose while video chatting. When it comes to the actual camera hardware: Resolution don't matter much, but low-light performance is important.

- Microphone placement is crucial. It must be away from noise-generating hardware such as the keyboard and fans. Ideally, the laptop can have multiple mics and use software to filter noise. Apple has dual-mic technology in all of their laptops. On the flip side, my ThinkPad x140e's microphone is in the palm rest.

I have yet to find any non-Apple laptop that gets *all* of these right. Even many Apple models miss the mark slightly.
