Some readers may have noticed that I haven't posted anything in a while. This is not due to laziness. I'm just very busy, as you can see from [my GitHub activity](https://github.com/ggreer/):

I'm spending a lot of time pair-programming with my co-founder, [Matt](https://github.com/kans/), so not all of those commits are mine. Still, I've never before worked as hard as I am working now.
