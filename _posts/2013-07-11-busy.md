I haven't posted anything in a while. This is not due to laziness. I'm very busy, as you can see from [my GitHub activity](https://github.com/ggreer/):

That's right, I've been writing code every day for the past 6 months. Actually, that's not quite true. One day I only committed some [JSLint](http://www.jslint.com/) and whitespace fixes. I did spend that day working, just not on code.

I'm spending a lot of time pair-programming with my co-founder [Matt](https://github.com/kans/), so not *all* of those commits are mine. Still, I've never before worked as hard as I am working now. It's as satisfying as it is exhausting.

I'll post more about what I've been doing in a couple of weeks.
