In Age of Em, Robin Hanson briefly discusses software rot as a specific instance of a more general principle:

I think he's right. Adapting mature software to new circumstances tends to take longer than writing new software from scratch. Open source software has several high-profile examples.


## Multi-process Firefox

When it was first written, Firefox had a single process model. After the release of Google Chrome, it was clear than a multi-process model allowed for better security and performance. Mozilla developers quickly began to sketch-out a path to making Firefox multi-process.

That was in 2007. Almost a decade later, Firefox *still* isn't multi-process.

compatible with existing extensions (or force devs to update their extensions)



## Event-driven Apache

When Apache httpd was first written, it used a process-per-connection model. One process would listen on port 80, then `accept()` and `fork()`. The child process would then `read()` and `write()`, finally closing and exiting when it was done. This architecture has the advantage of being simple, easy to implement on many platforms, andâ€¦ not much else. It's absolutely terrible for performance, especially when handling long-lived connections. To be fair, this *was* 1995.

Connection per process (fork)
Connection per thread ()
Event-driven (can support many more connections, immune to slowloris-style attacks)

Nginx was engineered with an event loop architecture. This allowed it to service many more concurrent connections.

httpd (multi-process, multi-thread) vs nginx (event-driven)



## CPython GIL

Python is slow.


## Conclusion

These are just a few
