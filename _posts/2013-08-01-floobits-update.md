10 months ago, [I wrote a post about starting Floobits](/2012/10/19/cross-editor-real-time-collaboration/). In it, I mentioned that Matt and I applied to [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/). We did not get in. We didn't even get an interview, just a generic e-mail.



That time.

We applied again in the spring and managed to get an interview for the summer 2013 batch. This was quite a surprise. I was so confident we wouldn't get an interview that I had booked a vacation to Japan with [Ed](http://edrooth.com/). I cancelled my hotel reservation and plane ticket.
