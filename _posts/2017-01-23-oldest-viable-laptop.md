What's the oldest laptop you could reasonably do your job with? 3 years old? 5 years? 10? And if asked the same question 10 years ago, would your number be higher or lower? Thanks to a failing battery in [my 12" MacBook]({% post_url 2015-04-19-2015-macbook-review %}), I discovered my answer.

For the 10 days it took to repair my MacBook, I had to use my backup laptop:

This is a [ThinkPad X61s](http://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:X61s). Despite being made in 2007, it's been fine for work. Yes, everything about it is worse than my MacBook. It's slower and heavier. It lacks a trackpad. The screen is a mere 1024x768, causing some websites to show their mobile layout.)[^font] Still, the experience has been significantly better than I predicted. The only major hardware drawback is the lack of video camera. The main sources of frustration have been software. Ubuntu 16.04 doesn't have a built-in dictionary or thesaurus. The default calendar app is a joke. And Thunderbird doesn't have a unified inbox view.

Had a similar circumstance happened 10 years ago, my oldest viable laptop would not be so old. That is to say: There's no way that in 2007, I'd be able to get by with a laptop from 1997. The performance issues would be insurmountable.

Growing up, I never thought I'd be able to use decade-old hardware without issue. Either laptop improvements are well into diminishing returns, or progress in hardware has stagnated, or both.
