IRC is a great way to get help when learning a new language or framework. 


1. Before you start asking for help on IRC, use Google and search the docs. Regulars will get annoyed if you ask questions that are answered in documentation. It shows you didn't try very hard to find the answer before wasting their time.
2. Don't ask to ask, just ask.
3. Explain what you think should be happening and what is actually happening. Be specific. Saying, "It doesn't work." will earn you the ire of every channel regular.
4. [Gist](https://gist.github.com/) any error logs or source code you have a problem with.
5. Explain what you're trying to do. Often there's an easier way to get what you want out of a language or framework. Others might know of a useful module or library that does much of the heavy lifting for you.
6. Finally, [don't be a dick](http://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/Don%27t_be_a_dick). Don't call their project stupid. Every piece of software has stupid parts. Granted, some have more stupidity than others, but name-calling isn't going to help fix the problems. More importantly, name-calling won't get you help.

Following these rules will make life much more pleasant for everyone involved. You'll be more likely to get your problem solved and the channel regulars will have less stress in their lives.
