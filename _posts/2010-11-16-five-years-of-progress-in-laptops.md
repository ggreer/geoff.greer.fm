There are a dozen things that don't show up in the numbers. The iBook's keyboard is spongy. It has a smaller trackpad that only supports two-finger scrolling. The iBook's display is much worse, although that may be due to age. The iBook's trackpad is plastic instead of glass. Even with a fresh install of Leopard, it feels slow. Yet somehow I used it as my main computer for two years.

In case you forgot, that skinny ethernet port on the iBook is a 56k modem. It's like ethernet, but data goes 1,800 times slower and makes angry noises.

I wonder what I'll compare my Air to in 2015.
