I was close to my earned-time-off cap, so I took the month of March off. The first half of the month consisted of a trip to Japan with [Paul](http://journal.paul.querna.org/), [Shawn](http://shawnps.net/), [Brad](https://github.com/morgabra), and Brad's wife Caity. It was quite enjoyable. We managed to have a pretty good balance of calm time and party time. I also paid off some of my [sleep debt](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleep_debt).

My favorite part of the entire trip was going to the 52nd floor of the Park Hyatt in Tokyo. We drank expensive cocktails while admiring [the Blade Runner-esque view](/photos/japan_trip/IMG_0978.jpg). There was a magnitude 6.1 earthquake right after we ordered drinks. I knew we were perfectly safe, but some primitive part of my brain panicked and released copious quantities of adrenaline. The building took a *long* time to stop swaying.

A close second was running in the hills above Kyoto as snow fell. The dusting of snow over the trees made for beautiful scenery.

I stopped in San Francisco for the weekend (and my birthday, also known as St. Patrick's Day). Now it's off to Chile and Argentina until the end of the month.
