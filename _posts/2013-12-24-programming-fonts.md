If you're going to spend a significant fraction of your life using something, it's worth spending more time and money on it than you might think. Chairs, beds, and [computers]({% post_url 2010-10-30-expensive-computers-are-worth-the-price %}) all fall in this category. 

The same applies when [toolsmithing](). Spending some time customizing your development environment can improve your productivity and reduce frustration. Most developers like to tweak their editors with various plugins and set up fancy shells. But one thing developers often overlook is fonts. Typically, developers go with the default fixed-width font for their terminals and editors. Some will choose one from the list of pre-installed fonts. This is a problem, since few fonts are optimized for development. Most fonts make it hard to distinguish `l`, `I`, and `1`, along with `0` and `O`. This can cause mistakes.

A font meant for developers should have certain properties:

1. Easily-distinguishable `0` and `O`.
1. Easily-distinguishable `1`, `l`, and `I`.
1. Easily-distinguishable `,` and `.`.
1. Centered operators such as `=`, and `*`.
1. Conspicuous parentheses `()`, brackets `[]`, and braces `{}`. Syntax highlighters reduce the need for this, but not everything has syntax highlighting.
1. Readable at small sizes. Big screens can help productivity. Since laptops have small screens, the only way to represent more information on them is to use smaller fonts.

The most useful group of fonts I've found for programming are the Proggy fonts. Sadly, the site hosting these fonts has died. Fortunately, I had most of the fonts backed-up. My favorite font is proggy-tiny, although many find it too small.

Even on my tiny 11" Air's screen, I can have a 153 columns and 65 rows of text.
