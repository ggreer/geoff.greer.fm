I've heard accusations of ageism throughout my career in silicon valley. While I do think older programmers often have a lower chance of being hired for a given job, I doubt the causes are often sinister. There are several explanations for the effect that don't involve any explicit discrimination.

Older programmers may not know the latest frameworks or languages. It doesn't take long to learn a new language, but many employers overvalue knowledge of specific skills.

Also, there may be selection effects skewing the abilities of older programmers. Many talented programmers get promoted into management. Many find a company they like, then stay there forever (Google). Others switch professions after losing interest in programming. Considering programmer compensation, I wouldn't be surprised if a fair number retired early. All of these effects might create a bimodal distribution of older talent: Those who do it because they love it, and those who do it because it's the only way they can get paid.


Dunning-Kruger
The mediocre programmers aren't aware of their mediocreness, so they think ageism is what's holding them back.

There's one very important aspect of ageism that needs mentioning: As soon as we reach maturity, our bodies and brains start to slowly decline. Nobody wants to admit it, but it's undeniable at this point. From age 20 to age 80, we lose about 30 IQ points. Until middle age, accumulated knowledge more than offsets the decline in raw cognitive ability. Eventually though, time catches up with us.

When does age-related cognitive decline begin?
