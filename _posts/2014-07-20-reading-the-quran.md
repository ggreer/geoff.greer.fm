A few weeks ago, I read the Qur'an<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> while on vacation. I'm not religious, but I figured it must have some positive qualities if over a billion people believe it to be the greatest book ever written. Also, it was a short read; maybe 15 hours total.

It turns out I was wrong about the Qur'an having positive qualities. Maybe it was helpful in the 7th century, but today it is an extremely outdated book. In many ways, it reminds me of Time Cube. The author sounds schizophrenic. There's very little structure to the whole thing. Suras veer off in random directions with little or no warning.

If I had to describe the Qur'an in one word It's as if someone loaded a cannon full of stock phrases and shot them into the text, peppering it randomly with, "God is all-merciful." "God is fully aware of what you do." "God is not unaware of..." etc. Over and over and over.

Then there's the hatred for unbelievers. The message of the Qur'an isn't, "Turn the other cheek." When it comes to infidels, quite the opposite is recommended. In addition, much time is spent gloating over the horrific fates of unbelievers. Muhammad can't stop talking about fire. He's like  Claude Frollo from Disney's Hunchback of Notre-Dame.

Finally, there's the sexism. The Qur'an is the most sexist text I've read.<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup> While it's possible to twist the text and interpret it as non-sexist (and Haleem's footnotes make a valiant attempt), a straightforward reading is unambiguous. To Muhammad, a woman is simply worth less than a man. 

Those who know me know I'm not religious. My parents were Catholic. They put me in Catholic schools for much of my childhood, so I was pretty much guaranteed to be non-religious. 


impressions:
might have been good advice in the 7th century, but extremely outdated today
reminds me of timecube
author sounds schizophrenic
very little structure. veers off in random directions with little or no warning
overly repetitive
  almost as if the same stock phrases were loaded into a cannon and shot at the text, peppering it randomly with "god is all-merciful", "god is fully aware of...", "god is not unaware of...",

*Tons* of hate for unbelievers. I guess unbelievers in the 7th century were violent.

muhammad can't stop talking about fire. he's like frollo from disney's hunchback of notre-dame

Extremely sexist. Women are simply lower than men in the eyes of Islam.


1. <span id="ref_1"></span>The specific version was [M. A. S. Abdel Haleem's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abdel-Haleem) [English translation of the Qur'an](http://www.amazon.com/Quran-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-ebook/dp/B001ODEPPI/), which is widely considered to be the best.
2. <span id="ref_2">I haven't read the Bible in its entirety.</span>
