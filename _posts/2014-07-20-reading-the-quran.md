A few weeks ago, I read the Qur'an<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> while on vacation. I'm not religious, but I figured it must have some positive qualities if over a billion people believe it to be the greatest book ever written. Also it was a short read, maybe 15 hours total.

It turns out I was wrong about the Qur'an having positive qualities. If I didn't already know how irrational people can be, I would be shocked that billions accept this book as gospel. It's lack of divine inspiration is obvious to anyone who isn't indoctrinated. For example: After a paragraph-long introduction sura, God apparently told Muhammad to title the second and longest sura *The Cow*. There is nothing in the Qur'an that couldn't have been written by a 7<sup>th</sup>-century schizophrenic who knew parts of the Old and New Testament. The entire text contains no references to basic biology, chemistry, or physics. There is no mention of the germ theory of disease, evolution, DNA, or fundamental physical constants. It would take only a few pages to outline these topics, and it would have saved humanity centuries of squalor and suffering.

The Qur'an may be scientifically uninformative, but it's morally reprehensible. The Qur'an endorses slavery. It recommends lethal punishments for benign actions. The message is anything but, "Turn the other cheek." The Quran wholeheartedly approves of violence against unbelievers. In addition, much time is spent gloating over the horrific fates of infidels. Muhammad can't stop fantasizing about fire. He's like Claude Frollo from Disney's Hunchback of Notre-Dame. And there's sexism. The Qur'an is the most sexist text I've read.<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup> While it's possible to twist the text and interpret it more equitably (Haleem's footnotes make a valiant attempt), a straightforward reading is unambiguous: A woman is simply worth less than a man. All of these failings make two things clear:

1. The Qur'an is a terrible moral guide.
2. It was authored by a 7<sup>th</sup>-century human.

When it comes to the structure of the text, there's very little to speak about besides its lack-of. The author comes across as schizophrenic. Suras veer in random directions with little or no warning. In many ways, it reminds me of [Time Cube](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_Cube). The Qur'an is repetitive. It's as if someone loaded a cannon full of stock phrases and shot them into the text, peppering it randomly with, "God is all-merciful." "God is fully aware of what you do." "God is not unaware of what you do." and so on. Over and over and over. One begins to wonder if God feels insecure.




1. <span id="ref_1"></span>The specific version was [M. A. S. Abdel Haleem's](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muhammad_Abdel-Haleem) [English translation of the Qur'an](http://www.amazon.com/Quran-Oxford-Worlds-Classics-ebook/dp/B001ODEPPI/), which is widely considered to be the best.
2. <span id="ref_2"></span>I haven't read the Bible in its entirety, but I bet it's similar.
