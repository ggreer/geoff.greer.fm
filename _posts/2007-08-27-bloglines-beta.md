This evening we finally launched [Bloglines Beta](http://beta.bloglines.com/), a redesign of the once-popular news reader. It's been the largest and most visible project that I've had a hand in, and I'm pretty happy with what has been accomplished so far.

Obviously not all the features are there yet, but it's nice to get some praise for the hard work.
