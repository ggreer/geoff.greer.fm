I recently finished taking the [Motorcycle Safety Foundation](http://www.msf-usa.org/)'s basic rider course and got my M1 endorsement. The next week-end I bought a brand-new (well it's a year old but it had zero miles on the odometer) 2007 [Kawasaki Ninja 250R](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kawasaki_Ninja_250R). I got a decent deal since Kawasaki redesigned the bike for 2008. Although considered a beginner bike, it's a ton of fun to ride. Even going in a straight line on the freeway is entertaining. Keeping up with traffic means the engine revs to almost 10,000 rpm and sounds like it's about to explode. Still, it's not exactly slow. The top speed is almost 110mph and it can go from 0-60 in less than six seconds.

Will just got a Canon Rebel XTI and was testing it out today:

Yes, the flames do make it go faster.

Edit: I rode to San Francisco and back today.
