Few people truly appreciate the scale of interstellar space. Space is so big that astronomers had to invent new units of measure: the astronomical unit, the light-year, the parsec. People hear these words. They can do calculations with them, but rarely do these terms evoke a feeling as concrete "mile" or "kilometer." I aim to correct this.

The [astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit) is the distance from the Earth to the Sun; about 90ish million miles. That's at the edge of our comprehension, yet it is ludicrously small compared to the distance to [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri): 4.4 light-years. 

There are â‰ˆ63,240 AU in a light-year.

There are 63,360 inches in a mile.
