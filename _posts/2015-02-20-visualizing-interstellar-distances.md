Few people truly appreciate the scale of interstellar space. Space is so big that astronomers had to invent new units of measure: the [astronomical unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_unit), the [light-year](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Light-year), the [parsec](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsec). People hear these words, they can do calculations with them, but rarely do these terms evoke a feeling as concrete "mile" or "kilometer." I stumbled on a way to correct this.

There are â‰ˆ63,240 AU in a light-year. In a fortunate coincidence, there are 63,360 inches in a mile. So if Sol was an inch from Terra, [Alpha Centauri](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_Centauri) would be four **miles** away. Our farthest probes would be 100 inches away, traveling three inches per year. In this miniature model, light takes 8 minutes to move an inch. Space is vast, but it's not beyond our comprehension.

Another tidbit: Distances to nearby stars are measured using [parallax](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stellar_parallax). One parsec is defined as the distance at which an object has an arc-second of parallax. Alpha Centauri's parallax is 0.8 arc-seconds. That's equivalent to looking at an object 4 miles away and moving your head two inches. The best instruments today can measure parallax as small as [20 micro arc-seconds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaia_(spacecraft)), giving accurate measurements for objects thousands of light-years away.
