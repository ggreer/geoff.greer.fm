I've returned from [Burning Man](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burning_Man). Of the photos I took, the best are on [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ggreer/sets/72157622149905297/). Some of the less interesting ones are in [my gallery](http://geoff.greer.fm/gallery/v/burn/).

I had a great time and I hope I can go again next year.
