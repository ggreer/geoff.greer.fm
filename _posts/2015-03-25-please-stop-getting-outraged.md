Over the past few years, I've noticed an increasing number of my peers engaging in a peculiar behavior. First, they read a news article or blog post describing something egregious happening to someone. Then, they proceed to voice their outrage to as many people as possible. They tweet about it. They talk about it on Facebook and IRC. They submit it to aggregators like Reddit and Hacker News. They write comments calling the perpetrator of this injustice a monster. They talk of how the accused deserves to have their life ruined. They condemn anyone who calls for restraint, raises objections, or doubts the story. A week later, the whole thing is forgotten. By then they've moved on to the next injustice-du-jour.

This behavior is absurd no matter how selfish or altrustic one tends to be. The world is big. So many terrible things happen that even comprehending them is impossible. If I voiced my outrage at every horrific thing I read about, I would be unbearable. Expressing such outrage reliably causes unhappiness and accomplishes nothing.

And considering the vast number of horrible things happening to people around the world, reacting to whatever you stumble upon and feel strongly about is an extremely wasteful method of prioritization. Our intuitions are terrible judges of suffering. We feel harm wrought by other humans is worse than harm wrought by nature, even though nature regularly visits misery beyond the most disturbed psychopath's crimes. [Scope insensitivity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scope_neglect) causes us to weigh ten lives as equal to ten thousand. Even simple things like lack of pictures or proximity can impede our ability to reason about harm. In this case, going with your gut will cause you to care about the wrong things.

Instead, it's better to think of injustices like an issue tracker you can never catch-up on. The only thing you can do is pick important issues you can do the most about, then actually do something about them. Venting your outrage is a waste of breath.

Since I would be a hypocrite of the highest order if I didn't follow my own advice: Today [I donated $1,000](https://www.againstmalaria.com/MyNets/126061) to the [Against Malaria Foundation](https://www.againstmalaria.com/). This charity been evaluated by [GiveWell](http://www.givewell.org/) as [one of the most cost-effective ways to save lives](http://www.givewell.org/international/top-charities/AMF).
