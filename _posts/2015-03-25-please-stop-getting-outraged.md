Over the past few years, I've noticed an increasing number of my peers behave in a certain pattern. First, they read a news article or blog post describing something egregious happening to someone. Then, they proceed to voice their outrage to as many people as possible. They tweet about it. They talk about it on Facebook and IRC. They submit it to aggregators like Reddit and Hacker News. They write comments calling the perpetrator of this injustice a monster. They talk of how this person deserves to have their life ruined. They condemn anyone who raises objections, calls for restraint, or doubts the story. A week later, the whole thing is forgotten. By then, they've moved on to some other injustice-du-jour.

This behavior reliably causes unhappiness while accomplishing nothing. It is absurd no matter how selfish or altrustic one intends to be.

If I got angry at every stupid opinion I saw online, I'd be a very a unpleasant person to be around.

Getting angry at whatever dumb
