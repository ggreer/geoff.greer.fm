Today marks my 365<sup>th</sup> consecutive day of commits.

<div id="github_streak_365" class="chart"></div>

This isn't as impressive as it might first seem. I did at least *some* work every day, but I also took time off to read, exercise, socialize, and generally have fun. Writing code is part of my life, not all of it.

To those who want to try something similar, I offer some advice.

First and most importantly, you have to *want* to do it. Without an innate desire, only inhuman willpower could sustain a year-long streak. Notice that I said *want* instead of *like*. There's a difference between [liking and wanting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6kx/wanting_vs_liking_revisited/). I rarely enjoy writing code, but I find myself compelled to do it.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> If you like doing this stuff, more power to you.

Make it a habit.

Second, brag about your streak. While it's usually good adice to [keep your identity small](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html), identity can sometimes work for you. If you view yourself as a prodigious committer, you'll be more motivated to continue your streak.

1. <span id="ref_1"></span>This has been the case for as long as I can remember. When I was 12, I spent two days trying to fix a bug in a CS121 assignment. I was almost in tears by the end of it. Finally, I asked my dad for help. He saw the `if (a = b)` immediately. A modern compiler would warn about an assignment in a conditional, but I was writing this in 1998 on an HP-UX machine.
