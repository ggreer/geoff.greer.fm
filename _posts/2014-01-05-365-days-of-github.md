Today marks my 365<sup>th</sup> day of consecutive commits.

<div id="github_streak_365"></div>

This isn't as impressive as it might seem at first. It doesn't mean I worked like crazy every day. I did do *some* work every day, but I also took time off to read, exercise, socialize, and just have fun. Writing code is part of my life.

To those who want to try something similar, I'll try to offer some advice.

First and most importantly, you have to want to do it. If you don't Notice I didn't say you have to *enjoy* it. There's a difference between liking and wanting.
