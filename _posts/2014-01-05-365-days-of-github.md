Today marks my 365<sup>th</sup> consecutive day of commits.

This isn't as impressive as it might first seem. I did do *some* work every day, but I also took time off to read, exercise, socialize, and generally have fun. Writing code is part of my life, not all of it.

To those who want to try something similar, I offer some (hopefully useful) advice.

First and most importantly, you have to *want* to do it. Without an innate desire, only inhuman willpower could sustain a year-long streak. Notice that I said *want* instead of *like*. There's a difference between [liking and wanting](http://lesswrong.com/lw/6kx/wanting_vs_liking_revisited/). I rarely enjoy writing code, but I find myself compelled to do it.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> If you like doing this stuff, more power to you. I started my streak mostly because I wanted to work on Floobits stuff. There's an insane amount of work to be done, so 

Second, set a reminder. When you're starting to get into the habit of committing daily, it's easy to forget. A simple alarm or calendar event can help. I missed a couple of days early on

Finally, brag about your streak<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup>. While it's usually a good idea to [keep your identity small](http://paulgraham.com/identity.html), identity can occasionally work *for* you. If you view yourself as a prodigious committer, you'll be more motivated to continue your streak. If you've bragged to others about your streak, you'll commit 

 The only way I'll break the streak is if I get very sick.

1. <span id="ref_1"></span>This has been the case for as long as I can remember. When I was 12, I spent two days trying to fix a bug in a CS121 assignment. I was almost in tears by the end of it. Finally, I asked my dad for help. He saw the `if (a = b)` immediately. A modern compiler would warn about an assignment in a conditional, but I was writing this in 1998 on an HP-UX machine. I don't why I wanted to keep programming after that. Any sane person would have chosen a different career.
