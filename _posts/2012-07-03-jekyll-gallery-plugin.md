I've tried hosting my photos all over the place: [Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/ggreer), [Gallery](http://gallery.menalto.com/), and Wordpress. [Making my site 100% static](/2012/02/21/from-wordpress-to-jekyll/) forced me to git rid of Wordpress and Gallery, so I made [a Jekyll plugin](https://github.com/ggreer/jekyll-gallery-generator) that generates galleries from directories of images. It's very simple, but it meets my needs. [See the results for yourself](/photos/).

Making this plugin was my first time writing [Ruby](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ruby_%28programming_language%29) in years. Most of my recent work has been C, [Python](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29), and Node.js. I've made [my views on Node](/2012/06/10/nodejs-dealing-with-errors/) quite clear. Python is what I typically use for getting things done, and C is my weapon of choice when speed is essential. Ruby is very similar to Python, but it has some nice syntactic sugar. There are annoyances, of course, but Ruby's surprises have been mostly pleasant. I hope to use it more often.
