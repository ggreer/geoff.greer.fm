Another common answer to, "What book should I read to learn C?", is [Zed Shaw's](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw)'s [*Learn C the Hard Way*](http://c.learncodethehardway.org/book/), AKA "LCTHW."


## Learn C the Hard Way: A Flawed Text with an Agenda

As harsh as that title may sound, I'm really not trying to court controversy. I have no grudge with Zed Shaw. In fact, I think he's a talented programmer and an excellent teacher. He has helped hundreds of thousands of people with his guide, [*Learn Python the Hard way*](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/). He has done far more to advance programming education than I could ever hope to.

It is for these reasons that I wish I didn't have to say: *Learn C the Hard Way* is not worth reading.

I'm not alone in this view. The most well-known (though in my opinion, very flawed) criticism of LCTHW is [Learn C the Wrong way](http://hentenaar.com/dont-learn-c-the-wrong-way) by Tim Hentenaar. While snarky and hostile, it does contain valid criticisms. The setup chapter is quite poor. The chapter on invoking the compiler is atrocious. It only talks of `make`, not directly invoking `gcc` or `clang`. In essence, it pretends there is only one way to invoke the compiler: a build system, and only one build system: `make`. I'm all for keeping things simple in introductory texts, but Shaw goes too far. 

I knew nothing about LCTHW or this spat until [someone asked for "peer reviews"](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming/comments/3rd4dg/peer_review_learn_c_the_hard_way_by_zed_shaw_pub/) in [/r/C_Programming](https://www.reddit.com/r/C_Programming).
