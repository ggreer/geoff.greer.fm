When asked why I use macs, I reply with something along the lines of, "Because macs don't annoy me as much as other laptops." That response is immediately followed by a request for examples. If this conversation is face-to-face, I boggle for a moment. There are so *many* examples that I have trouble enumerating them. For future reference, I've taken the time to list and explain these common annoyances.

In the infintesimal chance that a Lenovo exec reads this: Please consider it a list of things to verify before shipping new models.

## Trackpad

I sometimes wonder if laptop makers are controlled by a cabal of mouse manufacturers. Why else would so many companies churn out glitchy, barely-usable trackpads? It's the only explanation that makes sense: Make terrible trackpads so more people buy external mice. The alternative is that laptop makers are incompetent, and they can't *all* be incompetent, right?

Out of all the annoyances I run into, this is the most common. My 2014 ThinkPad's trackpad is inferior to the one on my 2005 iBook. Almost a decade separates the two machines, yet the newer one has a smaller, glitchier, worse-feeling trackpad. It's absurd.

There's no secret formula for a good trackpad. Make it big. Make it glass. Make decent drivers. Outside of Apple gear, few models satisfy even one of those three.

I long for the day when the only laptop users with mice are either gamers or psychotics. Judging from the current state of things, I doubt that day will ever come.

## Keyboard

If you ever find yourself agreeing with the statement, "PrintScreen should go between Ctrl and Alt.", put down the bottle of Kirkland Signature™ Absinthe and go to bed.

Given how important keyboards are at melding mind and machine, it makes sense that laptop makers would spend some R&D money on them. As far as I can tell, they are spending that money on novel ways to *ruin* keyboards. I don't want an "innovative" new layout. I don't want fancy "smart" function keys. I just want a normal keyboard!

## Screen

<a href="/photos/pics/retina_screen.jpg"><img alt="MacBook Air vs Retina MacBook" src="/photos/pics/thumbs/retina_screen.jpg" style="width:400px; height:350px; float:left; padding-right:16px;" /></a>

Skimping on a screen is like buying cheap glasses. Yes, you will save money. And you'll be annoyed by your frugality for thousands of hours. On the flip side, a high-resolution [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel) display is a continual joy to use.

When the retina MacBook Pros came out, I avoided looking at their screens. I didn't want to be tempted into getting something larger and heavier. Now the 12" MacBook is out and my suspicion is confirmed: Once you use a nice screen, you can't go back. Everything else looks blurry, blocky, and washed-out.

## Battery life

Most people need at least 9 hours of battery life. For software developers, that number is closer to 12. This may sound like a lot, but let me explain.

No sane person has ever said, "I wish this laptop's battery didn't last so long." Still, an astonishing fraction of laptops have terrible battery life. Below some threshold, battery logistics are a constant distraction. Carry a charger. Search for a seat near an outlet. Dim the screen. Close apps. Monitor battery percentage like it's the blood pressure of a trauma patient.

Longer battery life is liberating. Once it reaches a certain threshold, you just plug in at night and stop worrying. After experiencing this, it's impossible to go back.

<span id="size"></span>
## Size

Most laptops are far larger than they need to be. Apple's largest laptop is the 15" MacBook Pro. Compared to a lot of stuff out there, it's positively miniscule.

<a href="/photos/pics/IMG_1241.jpg"><img alt="My MacBook next to an UltraBook" src="/photos/pics/thumbs/IMG_1241.jpg" /></a>

Look at this UltraBook™®© next to my 12" MacBook. It's ultra-huge. Sure, most people *could* carry it around, but few would *want* to. Bigger laptops are more likely to be left at home. That's a problem, since (to borrow a photography aphorism) the best computer is the one you have with you.

<span id="suspend"></span>
## Suspend/Hibernate

Like trackpads, this is another simple aspect of laptops that almost everyone gets wrong. Here is how suspend and hibernate should work:

- When the lid closes, the laptop suspends to RAM. It consumes <1% battery per hour in this mode.

- When the lid *starts to open*, the laptop resumes. The screen is on and ready to go before the user can finish opening the lid.

- If the laptop is open but sleeping (often due to idle), hitting any key or clicking the trackpad will resume it. The screen should be on and ready to work within a second.

Bonus points if Bluetooth input devices can wake the laptop from sleep.

## Fans

Except for [high-end low-power designs]({% post_url 2015-04-19-2015-macbook-review %}), laptop fans are still a necessity.

<span id="drivers"></span>
## Drivers

Even the best hardware can be ruined by bad drivers. I would love to run Ubuntu on a Surface Pro, but the experience would be hell if it lacked decent drivers for the trackpad, camera, microphone, Bluetooth, WiFi, power saving, screen brightness, headphone switching, and a half-dozen other things that you only notice when they're broken.

This stuff isn't rocket science. No new technology needs to be invented. It just comes down to high standards and attention to detail.

## Other minor gripes

- Build quality. Cheap plastic is a deal breaker. Lightweight alloys of aluminum or magnesium are ideal.

- LEDs. The only thing worse than an always-on LED is a constantly blinking LED. Double points if it's one of those insanely bright blue LEDs. You might as well have a laptop that comes with an automatic eye-poking machine.

- Camera. The camera must be centered above the screen. Any other position will make for some weird shots. Occasionally, I'll see a model with the camera near the hinge. That's great if you want to look up someone's nose while video chatting. When it comes to the actual camera hardware: Resolution doesn't matter much, but low-light performance is important.

- Microphone placement is crucial. It must be away from noise-generating hardware such as the keyboard and fans. Ideally, the laptop can have multiple mics and use software to filter noise. Apple has dual-mic technology in all of their laptops. My ThinkPad x140e's microphone is in the palm rest, making it all but useless.

I have yet to find any non-Apple laptop that gets these right. Even many Apple models miss the mark slightly.
