When asked why I use macs, I reply with something along the lines of, "Because macs don't annoy me as much as other laptops." That response is immediately followed by a request for examples. If this conversation is face-to-face, I boggle for a moment. There are so *many* examples that I have trouble enumerating them. For future reference, I've taken the time to list and explain these common annoyances.

In the infintesimal chance that a Lenovo exec reads this: Please consider it a list of things to verify before shipping new models.

### Battery life

I think most people need at least 9 hours of battery life in typical usage. Software developers probably need 12. This may sound like a lot, but let me explain.

Nobody has ever said, "I wish this laptop's battery didn't last so long." Still, an astonishing fraction of laptops have terrible battery life. Below some threshold, battery logistics are a constant distraction. Carry a charger. Search for a seat near an outlet. Dim the screen. Close apps. Monitor battery percentage like it's the blood pressure of a cardiac patient.

Longer battery life is liberating. Once it reaches a certain threshold, you can just plug in at night and stop worrying. After experiencing this, it's impossible to go back.

### Size

Take a look at this UltraBook™®© next to my MacBook. It's ultra-huge. Sure, I *could* carry it around, but I don't *want* to. At the margins, bigger laptops will be left at home more often. Except when using netbooks, I've never thought, "This laptop is too small." And I've never thought, "This laptop is too light."

To borrow a photography phrase: The best computer is the one you have with you. That's why I get a small laptop and take it *everywhere*.

### Screen

<a href="/photos/pics/retina_screen.jpg"><img alt="MacBook Air vs Retina MacBook" src="/photos/pics/thumbs/retina_screen.jpg" style="width:400px; height:363px; float:left; padding-right:16px;" /></a>

Skimping on a screen is like buying cheap glasses. Yes, you will save money. And then you'll spend thousands of hours constantly being reminded of your frugality. Inversely, a high-resolution [IPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IPS_panel) display will be a constant joy to use.

I used MacBook Airs from 2010 until this year. When the retina MacBook Pros came out, I avoided looking at their screens. I didn't want to be tempted into getting something larger and heavier. Now the 12" MacBook is out, and I can confirm: Once you use a nice screen, you can't go back. Everything else looks blurry, blocky, and washed-out.

### Trackpad

Apple has a reputation for excellent trackpads. When I see someone using an external mouse with an Apple laptop, I think they're crazy. When I see the same thing with a Dell, I think, "That poor, poor soul."

There's no secret formula to a good trackpad. Make it big. Make it glass. Make decent drivers.

### Keyboard

So many laptops get this wrong. Do not alter the layout! Don't try to be fancy with "smart" function keys. Just make a normal keyboa

The keyboard is the part of the laptop users will interact with the most. Though opinions about keyboard "feel" are highly subjective, certain properties are disliked by everyone. Anything that's "squishy" or "wobbly" is a no-no.

<span id="suspend"></span>
### Suspend/Hibernate

Here is how suspend and hibernate should work:

- When the lid closes, the laptop suspends to RAM. It consumes <1% battery per hour in this mode.

- When the lid *starts to open*, the laptop resumes. The screen is on and ready to go before the user can finish opening the lid.

- If the laptop is open but sleeping (often due to idle), hitting any key or clicking the trackpad will resume it. The screen must be on and ready to work within a second.

### Fans

Except for the most advanced low-power hardware, laptop fans are a still necessity. 


---
<span id="drivers"></span>
### Drivers

Even the best hardware can be ruined by bad drivers.

Bluetooth, WiFi, camera, mic, trackpad, power saving, screen brightness, 

This stuff isn't rocket science. No new technology needs to be invented. It's purely attention to detail.

### Other minor gripes

- Build quality. Cheap plastic is a deal breaker. Lightweight alloys of aluminum or magnesium are ideal. Other materials might work.

- LEDs. The only thing worse than an always-on LED is a constantly blinking LED. Double points if it's one of those insanely bright blue LEDs. You might as well have a laptop that comes with an automatic eye-poking machine.

- Camera. The camera must be centered above the screen. Any other position will make for some weird shots. Occasionally, I'll see a model with the camera near the hinge. That's great if you want to look up someone's nose while video chatting. When it comes to the actual camera hardware: Resolution doesn't matter much, but low-light performance is important.

- Microphone placement is crucial. It must be away from noise-generating hardware such as the keyboard and fans. Ideally, the laptop can have multiple mics and use software to filter noise. Apple has dual-mic technology in all of their laptops. On the flip side, my ThinkPad x140e's microphone is in the palm rest.

I have yet to find any non-Apple laptop that gets *all* of these right. Even many Apple models miss the mark slightly.
