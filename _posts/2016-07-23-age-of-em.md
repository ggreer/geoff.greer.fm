Back in June, I read [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/)'s book: [*Age of Em: Work, Love and Life when Robots Rule the Earth*](http://ageofem.com/). I found it fascinating. Two months later, the book's ideas still pop into my mind daily. Nothing else I've read in the past year has done that. What follows is a summary of the core ideas in *Age of Em*, followed by my observations and critiques.


## The Author

> I expect my analysis to be relevant for a large cloud of different but similar scenarios. In particular, conditional on my key assumptions, I expect at least 30% of future situations to be usefully informed by my analysis. Unconditionally, I expect at least 10%.  
> – Robin Hanson, *Age of Em*

Let me make my bias known: I am a fan of Robin Hanson. He possesses a rare combination of intelligence, expertise, creativity, and civility. Moreover, he makes exceptional use of these gifts. Hanson looks at the big picture– the *really* big picture. For example: When examining [the growth of humanity over millions of years](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/the-growth-groove-game.html), the invention of writing is a rounding error. At such a high-level view, all of human history can be described by three eras of growth[^eras]:

1. 2,000,000 BC to 5,000 BC: Foraging, in which population doubled every 250,000 years.
2. 5,000 BC to 1600 AD: Farming, in which population doubled every 1,000 years.
3. 1600 AD to present: Industry, in which GDP doubled every 15 years.

These numbers are approximate, of course. Hanson also notes that each transition to the next era took less than a doubling time of the previous era. E.g. industry replaced farming as the dominant growth mode in less than the doubling time of farming (1,000 years).

If one extrapolates the numerological trend (admittedly, an absurdly weak argument), the next era after ours would have an economic doubling time on the order of months or weeks. This sounds crazy. How could a 200x speedup in economic growth *possibly* happen? What would life be like in such a world? *Age of Em* is Hanson's attempt to answer these questions.


## The Idea

> Seen up close and honestly, I expect the future usually to look like most places: mundane, uninspiring, and morally ambiguous, with grand hopes and justifications often masking lives of quiet desperation. Of course, lives of quiet desperation can still be worth living.  
> – Robin Hanson, *Age of Em*

Today, economic growth is bottlenecked by people. Machines can be mass-produced, but people take decades to mature and learn skills. It's possible to make more machines per worker, but one quickly runs into diminishing returns. Someone with 10 laptops or 10 bulldozers won't be 10x as productive.[^bottleneck] To speed-up economic growth by 200x, the bottleneck must be removed. Something must substitute for human intelligence.

When considering substitutes for human intelligence, most people's thoughts turn to artificial intelligence. But Hanson is pessimistic about the arrival of de-novo AI. He thinks it is more likely that [brain emulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) will come first.[^ai] (The "em" in *Age of Em* is short for "emulation".) Creating such ems requires three key technologies, and none of them exist today:

1. Fast, cheap computers.
2. High-resolution scans of one or more human brains.
3. Accurate models of all relevant cell types in the brain.

Hanson doesn't give any concrete timeline for when these technologies will exist. He only says "some time in the next century". Fortunately, none of his analysis depends on when ems become feasible, just that they arrive before AI.

Once ems are made, they'll differ from us in several ways:

1. Ems are immortal…-ish. So long as their hardware is maintained and powered, they can live indefinitely. This isn't as great as it sounds. Today's cars and houses are just as "immortal".
2. Ems can run at different speeds. Faster ems cost more to run, similar to how faster cloud servers cost more.
3. Ems can "teleport" by transmitting their mind-state across a network. If latency is low enough, they need only to transmit their input and output signals.
4. **Ems can be copied.** Most of *Age of Em*'s conclusions stem from this one difference.

Almost every chapter explores a different consequence resulting from these differences.


## My Observations

Reading *Age of Em* opened my eyes to how sloppy most futurism is. The field is filled with incomplete analyses and moralizing about the present day. In contrast, *Age of Em* treats the future like a real place. To use language from [construal level theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory): It kept me thinking in near-mode. I also liked the broad range of topics covered. Sections discussed physics, computer science, economics, language, culture, and politics. Basically, there's something in the book for everyone.

The section on lone software developers fascinated me.

While the ideas fascinated me, the writing itself was rather matter-of-fact. It wasn't as dry as an academic paper, but neither was it particularly compelling. This could be taken in a positive light. It means the book succeeds on its ideas alone, not just due to fancy writing. And it's not all dry. The penultimate chapter –on policy recommendations– uses more emotionally stirring language.

Hanson claims to be applying standard models and theories to his em scenario, but I don't know enough social science to tell if that's true. When the text entered my areas of expertise (computer science, software engineering), I found nothing objectionable. Also, I haven't heard any domain experts disputing his claim, so I'd bet money that Hanson correctly applied standard theories to this scenario.

I'm not sure if the author intended it, but the text works well as an ebook. There are plenty of references and links to related chapters, so I had no problem jumping around. Many footnotes contained URLs, making it easy to track down more info on conclusions I was more skeptical about. I wish more ebooks took advantage of the medium in these ways.


## My Criticisms

> In sum, even though many critics have reasonable points, I still think the analysis in this book was worth the effort.  
> – Robin Hanson, *Age of Em*

When it comes to *Age of Em*'s core ideas, I can't find any major flaws. To dispute them requires either rejecting Hanson's core assumptions or rejecting widely-accepted scientific models. The book contains so much detail that it would be easy to nitpick, but I don't want to write (and nobody wants to read) such pedantry.

In my opinion, the weakest part of *Age of Em* is Hanson's assumption that em minds won't be very tweakable. To be fair, I think it's a valid simplifying assumption. Most of the book is a straightforward, first cut analysis. Complicating the base assumptions would have made this book an intractable project. Still, one should not be very confident about how tweakable brain emulations can be.


space travel not likely
alternate possibility:
before em growth rates take off (say computation is last puzzle to be solved and ems only run close to human speed), probes are sent to mars.

How do holidays work? (dunno)
If leader copies are cheap, could you do a groundhog day attack on a leader? Might need mitigation.
Did Robin Hanson write this knowing about peak end effect? (no)
Doesn't talk about gene boosting. Of that happens before ems then only gene boosted humans will become ems 


## Conclusion

> …many of your ancestors would be tempted to disown you, if they were told many things about you. While they’d be pleased and impressed by many of your features, other things about you might horrify them.  
> – Robin Hanson, *Age of Em*

When examined closely, the em world doesn't sound so bad. They will be smarter and harder working than almost anyone today. They'll be happy and healthy and live long fulfilling lives.

Most importantly they'll be much better at solving AI risk. This book convinced me that the best path to reducing existential risk is to create ems.

As positive as my review is, I can't recommend *Age of Em* to everyone. It will only interest a small segment of people.

[^bottleneck]: You might ask, "If people are the bottleneck for economic growth, and population doesn't double every 15 years, then how does our economy do that?" The answer is that much of today's economic growth comes from making *better* machines.

[^ai]: Hanson backs this up with supporting evidence & reasoning in the book. A shorter version is in a blog post titled *[AI Progress Estimate](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/08/ai-progress-estimate.html)*.
