Back in June, I read [Robin Hanson](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/)'s book: [*Age of Em: Work, Love and Life when Robots Rule the Earth*](http://ageofem.com/). I found it fascinating. Two months later, the book's ideas still pop into my mind daily. Nothing else I've read in the past year has done that.

What follows is a summary of the core ideas in *Age of Em*, followed by my observations and critiques.


## The Author

Let me make my bias known: I am a fan of Robin Hanson. He possesses a rare combination of intelligence, expertise, creativity, and civility. Moreover, he makes exceptional use of these gifts. Hanson looks at the big picture– the *really* big picture. For example: When examining [the growth of humanity over millions of years](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2009/05/the-growth-groove-game.html), the invention of writing is a rounding error. At such a high-level view, all of human history can be described by three eras of growth[^eras]:

1. 2,000,000 BC to 5,000 BC: Foraging, in which population doubled every 250,000 years.
2. 5,000 BC to 1600 AD: Farming, in which population doubled every 1,000 years.
3. 1600 AD to present: Industry, in which GDP doubled every 15 years.

These numbers are approximate, of course. Hanson also notes that each transition to the next era took less than a doubling time of the previous era. E.g. industry replaced farming as the dominant growth mode in less than the doubling time of farming (1,000 years).

If one extrapolates the numerological trend (admittedly, an absurdly weak argument), the next era after ours would have an economic doubling time on the order of months or weeks. This sounds crazy. How could a 200x speedup in economic growth *possibly* happen? What would life be like in such a world? *Age of Em* is Hanson's attempt to answer these questions.


## The Idea

Today, economic growth is bottlenecked by people. Machines can be mass-produced, but people take decades to mature and learn skills. It's possible to make more machines per worker, but one quickly runs into diminishing returns. Someone with 10 laptops or 10 bulldozers won't be 10x as productive.[^bottleneck] To speed-up economic growth by 200x, the bottleneck must be removed. Something must substitute for human intelligence.

When considering substitutes for human intelligence, most people's thoughts turn to artificial intelligence. But Hanson is pessimistic about the arrival of de-novo AI. He thinks it is more likely that [brain emulations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_uploading) will come first.[^ai] (The "em" in *Age of Em* is short for "emulation".) Creating such ems requires three key technologies, and none of them exist today:

1. Fast, cheap computers.
2. High-resolution scans of one or more human brains.
3. Accurate models of all relevant cell types in the brain.

Hanson doesn't give any concrete timeline for when these technologies will exist. He only says "some time in the next century". Fortunately, none of his analysis depends on when ems become feasible, just that they arrive before AI.

Once ems are made, they'll differ from us in several ways:

1. Ems are immortal…-ish. So long as their hardware is maintained and powered, they can live indefinitely. This isn't as great as it sounds. Today's cars and houses are just as "immortal".
2. Ems can run at different speeds. Faster ems cost more to run, similar to how faster cloud servers cost more.
3. Ems can "teleport" by transmitting their mind-state across a network. If latency is low enough, they need only to transmit their input and output signals.
4. **Ems can be copied.** Most of *Age of Em*'s conclusions stem from this one difference.

Almost every chapter explores a different consequence resulting from these differences.


## My Observations

About halfway through *Age of Em*, I realized that many more similar books need to be written. Too much futurism is pure fantasy, or moralizing about the present day. I also realized that I don't know enough social science to tell whether Hanson is using these models correctly. On the topics I do know well, I saw no glaring errors.

While I found the ideas fascinating,], the writing itself was rather dry. It wasn't as bad as an academic paper, but neither was it particularly compelling. This could be taken in a positive light. It means the book stands up on the basis of its ideas alone, not just fancy writing.

I really enjoyed how specific, concrete, and detailed the text was. To use language from [construal level theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Construal_level_theory): It tries to keep the reader thinking in near-mode. I also liked the broad range of topics covered. They range from physics to computer science to economics to language to culture to politics. There's something in the book for everyone.

Section on lone developers fascinated me.



I'm not sure if the author intended it, but the text works well as an ebook. There are plenty of references and links to related chapters. I typically find technical ebooks to be inferior to their physical counterparts, but *Age of Em* had enough cross-links that I had no problem jumping around. I now wish more ebooks took advantage of the medium in this way.



> I expect my analysis to be relevant for a large cloud of different but similar scenarios. In particular, conditional on my key assumptions, I expect at least 30% of future situations to be usefully informed by my analysis. Unconditionally, I expect at least 10%.

> In sum, even though many critics have reasonable points, I still think the analysis in this book was worth the effort.

> In addition, many of your ancestors would be tempted to disown you, if they were told many things about you. While they’d be pleased and impressed by many of your features, other things about you might horrify them.


## My Criticisms

When it comes to *Age of Em*'s core ideas, I can't find any major flaws. To dispute them requires either rejecting Hanson's core assumptions or rejecting standard economics.

There are some details that I think aren't as strong as Hanson 

In my opinion, the weakest part of *Age of Em* is Hanson's assumption that em minds won't be very tweakable. I think it's a fine assumption to make. Most of the book is a straightforward, first cut analysis. Complicating the base assumptions would have made this book an intractable project.


My only real issue is with the writing style. Most of the book is very matter-of-fact. Once might even say the language is dry. The last chapter uses more emotionally stirring language. I'm not sure if that was intentional. If so, it's a good use of the [peak-end effect](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peak%E2%80%93end_rule).

space travel not likely
alternate possibility:
before em growth rates take off (say computation is last puzzle to be solved and ems only run close to human speed), probes are sent to mars.


How do holidays work? (dunno)

If leader copies are cheap, could you do a groundhog day attack on a leader? Might need mitigation.

Did Robin Hanson write this knowing about peak end effect? (no)

Doesn't talk about gene boosting. Of that happens before ems then only gene boosted humans will become ems 



### My Criticisms of Others' Criticisms

Lots of detractors say "what if you can change ems?" but I'm most cases, these don't affect the outcome much



## Conclusion

> Seen up close and honestly, I expect the future usually to look like most places: mundane, uninspiring, and morally ambiguous, with grand hopes and justifications often masking lives of quiet desperation. Of course, lives of quiet desperation can still be worth living.

Em world doesn't sound so bad when you examine it closely. They will be smarter and harder working than almost anyone today. They'll be happy and healthy and live long fulfilling lives.

Most importantly they'll be much better at solving AI risk. This book convinced me that the best path to reducing existential risk is to create ems.

As positive as my review is, I can't recommend *Age of Em* to everyone. It will only interest a small segment of people.

[^eras]: [Long-Term Growth As A Sequence of Exponential Modes](http://mason.gmu.edu/~rhanson/longgrow.pdf)

[^bottleneck]: You might ask, "If people are the bottleneck for economic growth, and population doesn't double every 15 years, then how does our economy do that?" The answer is that much of today's economic growth comes from making *better* machines.

[^ai]: Hanson backs this up with supporting evidence & reasoning in the book. A shorter version is in a blog post titled *[AI Progress Estimate](http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/08/ai-progress-estimate.html)*.
