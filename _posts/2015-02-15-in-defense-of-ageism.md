I've heard accusations of ageism throughout my career in silicon valley. While I do think older programmers often have a lower chance of being hired for a given job, I doubt the causes are often sinister. There are several explanations for the effect that don't involve any explicit discrimination.

Older programmers may not know the latest frameworks or languages. It doesn't take long to learn a new language, but many employers overvalue knowledge of specific skills.

Also, there may be selection effects skewing the abilities older programmers. Many talented programmers get promoted into management. Many find a company they like and stick with it for most of their careers (**cough** Google **cough**). Others switch professions after losing interest in programming. Considering programmer compensation, I wouldn't be surprised if a fair number retired early. All of these effects might add up to cause a bimodal distribution of older talent: Those who do it because they love it, and those who do it because it's the only way they can get paid.

And of course, there's the fact that our brains slowly decline as soon as we reach maturity. Nobody wants to admit it, but it's undeniable at this point. From age 20 to age 80, we lose about 30 IQ points. Until middle age, accumulated knowledge more than offsets the decline in raw cognitive ability. But eventually, time catches up with us.

When does age-related cognitive decline begin?
