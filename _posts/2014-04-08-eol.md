My grandmother died last month. It was sad, but not unexpected. Last summer, both of us visited my parents in Spokane. One day, she was short of breath. I took her to the hospital. After hours of tests and waiting, the doctor said her lungs were in horrible shape. The cause was most likely a form of rheumatoid arthritis. There was nothing they could do to restore the lost lung function. She'd have to be on oxygen for the rest of her life. I knew, right then, that she was going to die from this. I'm pretty sure everyone did, but nobody said it out loud.

I tried to spend more time with her while we were both in Spokane. She tolerated her new restrictions quite well. When she left to go home to Illinois, we hugged and said goodbye. I was pretty sure that would be the last time I'd see her. I was right. Over the next six months, grandma slowly suffocated as her lungs turned into scar tissue. It would have been nice to have seen her one last time.

The funeral was sad, but not unpleasant. Grandma had had plenty of time to arrange everything just how she wanted. The casket, the eulogist, the music, the burial plot, it was all very... grandma. Too tacky and over-the-top for my tastes, but coming from her, it was sincere.

One enjoyable bit was going through grandma's stuff. She had collected a lifetime of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. Many of my relatives knew 

I have a habit of thinking, "How can this situation be improved?" So often, the answer while I was in Illinois was, "We should have done this before grandma died." Everyone would have seen her one last time, and I think she would have enjoyed the company.
