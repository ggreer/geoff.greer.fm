My grandmother died last month. It was sad, but not unexpected. Last summer, both of us visited my parents in Spokane. One day, she was short of breath. I took her to the hospital. After hours of tests and waiting, the doctor said her lungs were in horrible shape. The cause was most likely a form of rheumatoid arthritis. There was nothing they could do to restore the lost lung function. She'd have to be on oxygen for the rest of her life. I knew, right then, that she was going to die from this. I'm pretty sure everyone did, but nobody said it out loud.

I tried to spend more time with her while we were both in Spokane. She tolerated her new restrictions quite well. When she left to go home to Illinois, we hugged and said goodbye. I was pretty sure that would be the last time I'd see her. I was right. Over the next six months, grandma slowly suffocated as her lungs turned into scar tissue. It would have been nice to have seen her one last time.

The funeral was sad, but not unpleasant. Grandma had had plenty of time to arrange everything just how she wanted. The casket, the eulogist, the music, the burial plot, it was all very... grandma. Too tacky and over-the-top for my tastes, but coming from her, it was sincere.

One interesting experience was going through grandma's stuff. She had collected a lifetime of photographs, letters, and newspaper clippings. Many of my relatives knew the people in the photographs, and recounted amusing or interesting stories about them. There were some faces lost to history. I wondered if grandma would have known about them.

I have a habit of thinking, "How can this situation be improved?"<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> So often, the answer while I was in Illinois was, "We should have done this before grandma died." Everyone would have seen her one last time, and I think she would have enjoyed the company. She probably would have enjoyed telling us stories about the faces in her old pictures.

Sadly, there are practicalities discouraging any sort of pre-death get-together. Most importantly, it's hard to predict when someone will die, even if they're close to death's door. There's also the fact that many are stricken with senility or dementia before their heart stops. Nobody wants to be remembered as that. Nobody wants to become like that.

There is an obvious solution to these problems, but nobody wants to talk about it. The law could simply allow for people to schedule their deaths. 

I firmly believe that sometimes the ethical, moral, *kind* thing to do is to end one

I have become a supporter of assisted suicide.

1. <span id="ref_1"></span>I also have a habit of asking, "How can this situation be worse?" [Who by Very Slow Decay](http://slatestarcodex.com/2013/07/17/who-by-very-slow-decay/) gives some idea of how much worse it could have been. I think asking both questions gives one a better sense of perspective.
