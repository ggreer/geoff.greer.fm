I am vexed by noise. Sirens. Car horns. Loud motorcycles. Screaming children. Drunken people yelling. Crazy people yelling. Deafening PA systems. **Cell phones.**

These distractions and annoyances drastically affect my quality of life. They cost me hours of lost time every week. Even though I wear earplugs or [IEMs](), I'm regularly interrupted, distracted, or otherwise bothered by noise.

It is *insane* that society allows many of these sources of noise. Riding a Harley around San Francisco affects thousands of people. 

Having been to other countries, I can say the US isn't the worst when it comes to allowing noise, but it's still pretty bad.

Japan's social mores heavily censure noise. It's amazing. You can go on a train and not be annoyed.

I'm confused that many people aren't as annoyed by noise as I am. My biggest fear is that Paul Graham's hypothesis is right: Their thoughts aren't interrupted because they don't have inner thoughts to interrupt.
