Although I'm not writing much Node.js anymore, I'm still feeling the cost. Node has conditioned me to distrust tools. Often when debugging something, I'll suspect the debugger is lying. This was a common occurrence in Node. Variables that were in scope would disappear after their last mention in the code. (Garbage collected, presumably.) Breakpoints were more like guidelines. Behavior in the REPL wasn't quite the same as the actual code.
