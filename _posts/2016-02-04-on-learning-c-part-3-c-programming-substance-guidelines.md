## C Programming Substance Guidelines

Another C guide [was posted on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10157018): [C Programming Substance Guidelines](https://github.com/btrask/stronglink/blob/master/SUBSTANCE.md). I disagreed with some of its recommendations, including the endorsement of Shaw's *Learn C the Hard Way*, so I left a comment on the HN submission.
