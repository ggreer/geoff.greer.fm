One problem with products made by startups is that they have short life-expectancy. Even if a startup succeeds and is acquired, often their products go into maintenance-mode. 

There is a huge list of successful startups whose products have stagnated and died: Etherpad, Stypi, Cloudkick.

This doesn't just affect the customers. It poisons the well for all startups. It's harder to get off the ground if people are worried you'll drop a product as soon as you're acquired.

Because of this, I'd like to suggest that startups have a responsible exit pledge. Here are some guidelines:

* After acquisition, keep everything running for a while. For most products, a year makes sense.
* Give plenty of notice before shutting things down. The first number that pops into my head is 6 months.
* Make it possible for anyone to run a fully-featured instance of the product. This means releasing the source code and documenting how to set-up and run your product. I realize startup code and architectures are seldom clean, but it should be reasonably painless to set up.


A concrete pledge might look something like this:

Here at Global Widgets LLC, we know how frustrating it can be to adopt a product only to have it die soon after. That's why we pledge to sunset our products in a responsible manner.
