C is an important language for many reasons. It's ubiquitous. It's *fast*. It gets you closer to the bare metal than anything but assembly.

There is likely no other language that can run on so many platforms.

It has a long history, much of it tied up with the beginnings of UNIX.

It also has a reputation for being hard to master.



Unlike those who read the titular book, I actually *did* learn C the hard way. I was twelve years old.
