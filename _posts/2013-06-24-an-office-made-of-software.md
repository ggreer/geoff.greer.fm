Imagine if tomorrow, wormhole technology became not only feasible, but stupendously cheap. The impact on the world would be tremendous, but let's focus on one parochial question: What would happen to workplaces?

I'd bet a lot of money that most companies would ditch their offices. Real estate costs money, and there's no much point in making everyone commute when workers can just open wormholes to each other whenever they need to interact. 

There are other interesting implications. Workers wouldn't be forced to uproot their lives for their dream job. And companies could hire employees anywhere in the world. Each worker's location would matter only so much as their desire to stay synced to their local time zone.


Now imagine if instead of wormhole technology, realistic holographic prescence became cheap. How would the scenario change? A lot of companies would still have to have offices, but many could still go fully-decentralized.



I often think of how crazy offices are. I'm talking about the idea of offices, not the environment in them (although that can be just as crazy). 

People sleep in one place, then they waste time traveling to the office. 

An office takes up valuable real estate, but is empty half of the time. Likewise, the workers' homes are empty for 8 hours a day. Everyone wastes time commuting. Workers burn gas, wear-out their cars, and generally subject themselves to soul-sucking amounts of stress each day, all just to carry out their jobs. In what world could this system possibly make sense?

Well, the whole point of an office is to get work done. Companies like to make money, and they wouldn't spend money on offices if it didn't make sense... right?

I must digress a little to address this point. Many organizations make incredibly bad decisions. Individuals in organizations often have poor incentives. Most importantly, people get fired for screwing up. This causes organizations to be overly risk-averse. "Nobody ever got fired for buying IBM equipment" is the common stereotype of this behavior. Since workers are incentivized to not make mistakes, they often avoid risks and copy the decisions of people in similar situations. Everyone else is doing X? We should do X. Most of the time, this is a reasonable heuristic. If everyone else jumps off a bridge, [you probably should too](http://xkcd.com/1170/). Most of the time, these desicions aren't even explicit. Of *course* you're going to have an office. How else would people work together? Companies have had offices for centuries. When would it ever make sense to change that?

It's often wise to re-evaluate these implicit decisions, because sometimes they no longer make sense. While offices are  for many jobs today, there is one specific sector where I think they're no longer beneficial: software companies.





What do programmers do all day? They read code. They write code. They read docs. They (hopefully) write docs. They communicate with coworkers through IRC, e-mail, instant messenger, phone calls (*ugh*), group meetings, and face-to-face interactions. 


GitHub, 37signals, and others have shown this can work, but I don't think they go far enough. They still have a main office.

Offices hinder software companies in many ways. They limit companies to nearby talent. They have to get visas for foreigners. 

Different office plans can cause problems. An open office plan creates noise and distraction. Giving everyone their own private room is expensive. An in-between solution can breed jealousy and resentment between workers. 


It is insane that software companies have developers in offices. What do people at software companies do? Either they write software or they provide logistical support to the people writing software. Those who write code spend much of their time at a computer. Between bouts of browsing reddit, these people communicate with each other and write code. 


A reasonable heuristic is to do what everyone else is doing.
