I recently rode the Idaho Hot Springs loop with my dad & my uncle. In nine days, we traveled 510 miles and climbed 37,000 feet. It was rather enjoyable.

For details, read [my dad's write-up](http://www.shallowcogitations.com/2016/07/my-brother-my-son-and-i-went-for-bike.html). You can also view [my photo gallery of the trip](/photos/idaho_hot_springs_loop_2016/).


Lastly, I tracked the entire route on Strava:

Lastly, this trip caused me to break my GitHub streak. I brought my laptop, but most nights I was too tired to do anything.
