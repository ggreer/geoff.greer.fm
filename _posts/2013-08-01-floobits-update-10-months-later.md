[10 months ago, I wrote about starting Floobits](/2012/10/19/cross-editor-real-time-collaboration/). In it, I mentioned that Matt and I applied to [Y Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/). We did not get in.

<br />
...that time.

We applied again in the spring and got an interview for Y Combinator's summer 2013 batch. This was quite a surprise. I was so confident we wouldn't get an interview that I had booked a week-long vacation to Japan with [Ed](http://edrooth.com/). As I cancelled my hotel reservation and plane ticket, I wondered how crazy my decision was. The interview only lasts 10 minutes, and maybe 1/5th of interviewees get into YC. The [expected value](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expected_value) calculation vastly favored doing the interview, so I ignored my gut feeling. Still, I planned on getting rejected.

<!-- Matt and I spent a couple of days preparing for the interview. Neither of us are good at selling stuff, so we figured we should have a great demo of Floobits. To make sure there were no hiccups with network access, we connected our laptops with an ethernet cable and ran a local instance of Floobits. It was rather amusing to walk into the interview room with two laptops connected by a wire. -->

<!-- The interview was absurdly fast. We answered questions to varying levels of satisfaction. Our demo went well. We drove back to San Francisco in rush hour traffic and talked about our chances. I put our odds at 50%. I dropped off Matt and managed to return the Zipcar with one minute to spare.

As soon as I walked into my apartment, I got a phone call.

In order I contacted:

1. Matt
1. My parents
1. Friends and former coworkers who knew we had applied to YC. (To coordinate logistics for becoming inebriated.)
-->

But somehow, we got accepted. That evening we went to Zeke's for beers, which turned into beers and shots of tequila. It was a fun night.

Then Matt and I spent every day writing code, talking to users, and exercising.

About a month ago, we turned on billing. In the past two weeks, we started to get our name out there. First, we [showed Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=6064608). The reaction was unexpectedly positive. Our poor Node.js server died under the immense load. This week, [we launched on TechCrunch](http://techcrunch.com/2013/07/30/floobits-debuts-remote-pair-programming-tool-where-you-can-collaborate-in-your-favorite-native-editor/). And of course, [Y Combinator posted about us](http://blog.ycombinator.com/floobits-yc-s13-lets-you-write-code-with-others-directly-in-sublime-text-emacs-vim-pair-programming-done-right).

I have spent 2% of my life in an uninterrupted streak of writing code every day. And yet, I consider myself incredibly lucky. Lucky to get into Y Combinator. Lucky to have met Matt. Lucky to have friends who give good advice. Lucky I was interested in computers instead of French literature.

Most of all, I'm lucky to have the genes and upbringing that caused me to be a rather intelligent, hard-working person.

In other words, thanks Mom & Dad!
