I sometimes wonder if burnout is our version of [fan death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death). The brain is not a muscle. Stress and sleep deprivation can take a toll, but no amount of thinking can hurt it. There are people who simply don't burn out. You may not have worked with any, but they certainly exist. They spend their time doing what they think is most important. They're not superhuman, but they are good at avoiding distractions.

I'm not that devoted, but I've been writing code every day for two years. It's become a deeply-ingrained habit. So much so that it would take effort to stop my streak rather than continue it. Similarly, some people have television habits. It would take them effort to stop watching TV rather than continue doing so.

I think encouraging healthy habits would do more good than encouraging downtime (especially when it's something as mind-numbing as most television).
