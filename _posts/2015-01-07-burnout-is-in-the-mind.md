I sometimes wonder if burnout is the western version of [fan death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fan_death). When you think about it, burnout makes little sense. People get depressed and tired from... what, exactly? Working too much? Working too hard? Excessive drudgery? Bull. We are working less than ever before. Just over a century ago, the average work week was over *60 hours*. Today, it's 33.<sup>[\[1\]](#ref_1)</sup> Past occupations also involved toil and danger far greater than any employment today. Yet burnout is a modern phenomenon. Strange, eh?

Another argument against burnout comes from biology. The brain is not a muscle. Stress and sleep deprivation can take a toll, but no amount of thinking can hurt it. In fact, thinking is practically all we do while awake. Only with dedication and practice can one reduce the constant stream of thoughts impinging upon consciousness.<sup>[\[2\]](#ref_2)</sup>

And lastly, burnout is not universal, even in cultures where it is well-known and accepted. There are people who simply don't burn out. You may not have worked with any, but they certainly exist. They're not superhuman. Actually, many of them seem quite normal.

This isn't to say I think those who claim to be burnt-out are faking. I don't doubt that burnout describes a real phenomenon. What I *do* doubt is the accepted cause (work) and the accepted cure (time off from work). It seems much more likely that burnout is a form of depression<sup>[\[3\]](#ref_3)</sup>, which has a myriad of causes and cures.

Why am I making all this noise about burnout? To suggest the following without prompting a visceral rejection: Don't worry about working too much. If you want to work, do so. The important thing is to avoid depression. Try to form healthy habits. Get out. Exercise. And stay the hell away from negative media such as cable news and Tumblr.

I don't consider myself very devoted to my work, but I've been writing code every day for two years. It's become a deeply-ingrained habit. So much so that it would take effort to stop rather than continue.

Similarly, some people have television habits. It would take them effort to stop watching TV rather than continue doing so.

I think encouraging healthy habits would do more good than encouraging down time. Especially when it's something as mind-numbing as most television.
