Lately I've had a problem at [work](http://www.rackspace.com/): noise. The Rackspace San Francisco office is an [open plan](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open_plan), so noises and distractions are rampant. [Studies show](http://lapa.co.nz/assets/NewsAttachments/openplanofficeszengine.pdf) that open offices destroy productivity, increase stress, and decrease quality of life. The main reason they exist is because they're cheap.

Until recently, it was tolerable. I could use headphones to help block the noise. But as the company hired people and the office became more crowded, I was like a frog in a slowly-heated pan. My headphones gradually got worse at drowning out the noise. People began talking louder so they could communicate over the constant chatter of everyone else. People started taking phone calls at their desks.

The situation came to a head when I started [pair programming](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pair_programming). Since my coworker and I needed to communicate constantly, we couldn't use headphones. We tried moving to various places in the office, but nothing worked. Noise was everywhere. Eventually, we snapped. Fed-up with the noise, we cleaned out a closet and threw a desk in it. For a time, it was heaven. We were productive and happy. Free from constant distractions, I woke up each morning actually looking forward to work.

Less than a week after we settled into our new "office", my boss's boss talked to me. He ordered me to move out of the closet, saying it was unfair to others. This sucked for several reasons: First, I was forced to go back to constant noises and distractions. Second, it meant I couldn't trust my own coworkers. Third, it meant I couldn't count on my manager to shield me from these issues.

So I quit.

That means I'm looking for a new job. [My resume](/resume.html). [My GitHub](https://github.com/ggreer) Email me at geoff at greer.fm.
