I got some Magguts +2 kits for my 15 round P365 magazines, but the kit only came with sleeves for the P365 XL. Those sleeves didn't sit flush with the base of the grip, so I designed and printed some that would.

Printing with PLA works fine, but glass filled nylon is probably a better choice for long term durability.
