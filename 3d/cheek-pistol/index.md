The cheek pistol is a concept I first learned about from Rhett Neumayer. [He showed how a modified Kel-tec CP-33 could be used as a compact personal defense weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY4zGd7uyd0). The folks at Forgotten Weapons [tried a similar setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhfluziKZBY) and were impressed by its effectivness. The concept appealed to me, but I didn't want to buy a Kel-Tec CP33. I ended up designing a clamshell that fits over a standard pistol. It covers the slide and provides an optic rail, allowing it to be aimed and used while held against one's cheek.

This is definitely a prototype at the moment.

## Models

{% include model.md name="cheek-p365" title="Sig P365 Cheek Pistol" %}

{% include model.md name="cheek-glock" title="Glock Cheek Pistol" %}

This might work with other pistols that use picatinny rails, but I've only tested it with Glocks. I know that it won't work with higher bore offset pistols such as the CZ P-01 or anything from Sig.

{% include model.md name="picatinny-locking-pin" title="Picatinny Locking Pin" desc="Print at least one of these to insert through the holes in the picatinny rail. This will help lock the pistol into the frame, preventing the frame from coming loose while firing." %}

{% include model.md name="charging-handle" title="Charging Handle" desc="The charging handle uses a 3mm or 1/8th inch hex wrench to guide its reciprocation in the shell." %}


## Instructions

Print the shell with the front down. If your printer is dialed in you shouldn't need any supports. The charging handle should not be printed vertically, as the layer lines will weaken it significantly.

When you put the shell on your pistol, you'll want to position it such that when the slide is forward, the charging handle has about a millimeter of play. If there's no space between them, then the slide will bash the charging handle every time the gun cycles.

If the locking pins are too wide for your pistol's picatinny slots, a zip tie will do in a pinch.
