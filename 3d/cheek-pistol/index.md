title: Cheek Pistol

The cheek pistol is a concept I first learned about from Rhett Neumayer. [He showed how a modified Kel-tec CP-33 could be used as a compact personal defense weapon](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uY4zGd7uyd0). The folks at Forgotten Weapons [tried a similar setup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QhfluziKZBY) and were impressed by its effectivness. The concept appealed to me, but I didn't want to buy a Kel-Tec CP33. I ended up designing a clamshell that fits over a standard pistol. It covers the slide and provides an optic rail, allowing it to be aimed and used while held against one's cheek.

This is definitely a prototype at the moment.

This might work with other pistols that use picatinny rails, but I've only tested it with Glocks. I know that it won't work with higher bore offset pistols such as the CZ P-01 or anything from Sig.
