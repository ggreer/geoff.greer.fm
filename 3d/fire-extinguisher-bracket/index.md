I wanted to mount a fire extinguisher in my trunk without drilling any holes, so I designed this bracket. The back can be covered in velcro to stick onto the carpet in the trunk. To use the extinguisher, you just rip the whole thing off the velcro. I probably could have saved filament and sped up print time by removing some material in the center.
