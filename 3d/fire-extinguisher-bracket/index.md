I wanted to mount a fire extinguisher in my trunk without drilling any holes, so I designed this bracket. The back can be covered in velcro to stick onto the carpet in the trunk.

{% include model.md name="fire-extinguisher-bracket" title="Fire Extinguisher Bracket" desc="This fits an [Amerex B402 fire extinguisher](https://www.amazon.com/Amerex-Chemical-Class-Extinguisher-Bracket/dp/B00F5CK9X6/). You may need to alter the diameter to fit other extinguishers." %}
