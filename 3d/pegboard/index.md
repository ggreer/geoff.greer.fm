## Trays

{% include model.md name="pegboard-tray" title="Pegboard Tray" desc="This pegboard tray is parameterized. If you change the dimensions in the OpenSCAD file, it will automatically generate the correct mounting pegs. You can tweak other attributes such as peg diamter, though the default should work with most pegboard." %}

I've also generated STL files for some common tray sizes.

## Electrical

{% include model.md name="pegboard-outlet-box" title="Pegboard Power Outlet Holder" desc="This lets you mount a standard light switch or power outlet on pegboard." %}

{% include model.md name="pegboard-outlet-back" title="Pegboard Power Outlet Holder (back)" desc="The back of the outlet holder." hide_scad=true %}

I designed this to make a switch for a light above my work bench. It will fit any standard outlet or switch. The two parts dovetail into each other, so you may need to tweak the tolerances for your printer.

{% include model.md name="surge-protector-pegboard" title="Pegboard Surge Protector Holder" desc="This lets you mount a surge protector on pegboard. You'll probably need to customize the OpenSCAD file for your particular surge protector." %}
