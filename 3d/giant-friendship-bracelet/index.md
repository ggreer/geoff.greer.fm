{% include model.md name="circle-letters" title="Letters for giant friendship bracelet" desc="Paint the recessed parts black, then run some fishing line through each disc. You can garnish the line with some ball pit balls or other decorations. Depending on your printer, you may need to tweak the diameter of the hole going through each disc. You can also use a needle to poke through any extra filament in the holes. One side says \"Merry Christmas\" and the other side says \"Happy New Year\". You can edit the OpenSCAD file to be any letters you want." %}
